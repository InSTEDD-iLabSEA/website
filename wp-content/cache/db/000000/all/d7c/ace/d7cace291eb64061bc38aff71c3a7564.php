How is the <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE60G16420100117">Emergency Information Service</a> I described yesterday working on the ground? As of earlier today, over 700 people had subscribed to the service, and EIS was able to send out several alerts to the community about where to get medical care and help.  Translated messages can be viewed at <a href="http://haiti.ushahidi.com/">Ushahidi's Haiti site</a>.</p>
<p>Here is one example of how technology helped our teams from the United States and Haiti coordinate relief across the ocean using EIS and other tools in near real time. It started when one of our US-based Haitian-American translators alerted us to an email she received from a Haitian USENET group Corbetre of  a hospital available to receive patients.  She told me about it over <a href="http://www.skype.com/welcomeback/">skype</a>, and I alerted our team in Haiti over a skype chat (which they were accessing through an <a href="http://www.inmarsat.com/Services/Land/BGAN/default.aspx">Inmarsat BGAN</a> satellite).  Reuters confirmed the hospital did indeed have room, after which another one of our US-based translators turned the report into 140 Kreyol characters, sent it over skype back to Haiti, where it went out over the EIS System to the 700 subscribers. All of this happened within 10 minutes of us learning about the hospital.</p>
<p>I wish I could say that, because of what we did, lives were immediately saved. Unfortunately, reality is not that straightforward.  It turns out that the hospital is a 5 hour drive from Port au Prince and the road is so treacherous it requires helicopters to transport patients there (so we also contacted the U.S. military helicopter coordinators).  Technology is but one critical piece of a much larger aid effort.  Let us hope we can soon answer our Haitian friend's text "when will it end?" with now.</p>";s:10:"post_title";s:57:""Ebyen kile tranbleman de te a ap fin pase potoprens en?"";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:142:"When is the earthquake going to end? is what the phrase above means in Kreyol, and it is one of the messages our team in Haiti received today.";s:11:"post_status";s:7:"publish";s:14:"comment_status";s:6:"closed";s:11:"ping_status";s:4:"open";s:13:"post_password";s:0:"";s:9:"post_name";s:54:"ebyen-kile-tranbleman-de-te-a-ap-fin-pase-potoprens-en";s:7:"to_ping";s:0:"";s:6:"pinged";s:0:"";s:13:"post_modified";s:19:"2011-06-22 15:00:09";s:17:"post_modified_gmt";s:19:"2011-06-22 22:00:09";s:21:"post_content_filtered";s:0:"";s:11:"post_parent";s:1:"0";s:4:"guid";s:85:"http://instedd.org/2010/01/18/ebyen-kile-tranbleman-de-te-a-ap-fin-pase-potoprens-en/";s:10:"menu_order";s:1:"0";s:9:"post_type";s:4:"post";s:14:"post_mime_type";s:0:"";s:13:"comment_count";s:1:"1";}i:1;O:8:"stdClass":23:{s:2:"ID";s:4:"1818";s:11:"post_author";s:1:"1";s:9:"post_date";s:19:"2009-02-23 21:25:00";s:13:"post_date_gmt";s:19:"2009-02-23 21:25:00";s:12:"post_content";s:6890:"<p>Tonight I learned that our inspiration at InSTEDD, Dr. Larry Brilliant, is stepping down from his position as Executive Director of Google.org.</p>

<p>From InSTEDD's perspective there is quite a bit of history in that event. Larry's TED Prize led to the formation<a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/larry_brilliant_wants_to_stop_pandemics.html"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-2001" title="Larry-TED" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/Screen-shot-2010-12-21-at-10.25.45-PM.png" alt="" width="346" height="338" /></a> of this organization, including our odd name (an inside joke during the TED acceptance speech), and our admirable charter to use technology to improve detection of, and response to, crises. He hired me as CEO in 2007 and, for the past 18 months that I've known Larry, he's been one of the most kind, intelligent, intense, and creative men I've ever had the pleasure to know. I'll miss his voice at the helm of Dot-Org.</p>

<p>It's valuable to remember that Larry's TED Wish, for "Better Early Detection, Better Early Response" against emerging infections and natural disasters, has sparked ideas all over the globe, including the suite of capabilities we've introduced here at InSTEDD.</p>

<p>Larry encouraged us to look very closely at the problems he was worried about. He had spent years in India and knew well that nothing much could be designed to help villagers report diseases unless someone with a technical background went out to LIVE there, helping them understand the art of the possible while immersed with them in the reality of the day. Naturally enough, ideas for other people work best when designed <span style="font-weight: bold;">with</span> those people. We need to fit our suggestions into their needs, their culture, their workflow, and their desires. Users need to own the process, the design, and the result. He has never let us forget that and his concern has paid off handsomely.</p>

<p>He recognized that, to be effective, we needed to share the problems of unreliable power, dangerous insects, dirty water, leftover landmines, cross-cultural suspicion, illiteracy, cold, heat, and all the rest. But he also knew we'd find in those villages courage, and intelligence, and discipline, and sacrifice, and a passionate desire to do the best possible job, even when resources are maddeningly scarce and lives are lost for truly stupid reasons. A small scratch becomes an abscess. A mosquito bite carries Yellow Fever. No gasoline for the ambulance. Tires buried in mud. No aspirin. No chlorine. No clean gloves. No toilet. No soap. A thousand little events no longer seen in the modern world but that can make a trivial problem fatal where we work.</p>

<p>At InSTEDD, being true to Larry's TED Prize Wish, we've worked hard on determining just how Larry's "Better Early Detection, Better Early Response" could be achieved. As we researched the problem in Geneva with the World Health Organization, in Atlanta with the Centers for Disease Control, in Cambodia, Bangladesh, Ghana, Peru and elsewhere, we found one constant, ubiquitous, and overwhelming problem: Collaboration. People with information couldn't share it with those who needed to know. Either it was too hard to report that sneezing chicken, or some system couldn't read that file type, or the message was buried invisibly in the morass of other things people had to read and was lost before a team of experts could think about it.</p>

<p>We looked around carefully and saw that plenty of people were doing open-media analysis. We saw that many others were doing cellphone-based communication. We recognized that we needed to stitch it all together and make sense out of it all. We needed to link community health workers to everyone that needed to see their information. We needed to translate that information between all of the systems where experts were trying to keep track and couldn't. We needed to help those experts get together to think about  that one small "something" that didn't look right.</p>

<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/geochat-JPEG.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2009" title="geochat-JPEG" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/geochat-JPEG-300x270.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="270" /></a>And that's what we've done. GeoChat, Mesh4x, and Riff are in beta and in use in useful corners of the world. We now have health workers talking amongst each other in Mongolia and in Cambodia and in Ghana. We have world-renowned epidemiology software for the first time able to pool information from different locations by forming a "mesh", measurably improving the statistical power of the analysis. That mesh synchronization is working for HIV Clinics in Africa as well. We have global monitoring offices in world capitals using our analytical techniques to watch information pouring in, spot anomalies, and notify the real humans that something's wrong, while automatically generating a set of ideas about what the problem might be. It's really good stuff.</p>

<p>We've also developed a work plan and a curriculum to teach what we know.  We've made sure anyone working with us can take full ownership of our tools by making them free and open source, and by carefully training our users in software languages and techniques so that they can alter the tools whenever they like to meet their changing needs. We've noted, happily, that we're slowly reversing brain drains and beginning to build little Brain Trusts.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.TrackerNews.net"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-2003" title="trackernews" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/Screen-shot-2010-12-21-at-10.23.19-PM.png" alt="" width="314" height="201" /></a>We've also discovered how much useful science and technology is invisible to the humanitarian community and started a website to make those links more visible. The site is at <a href="http://www.trackernews.net/">www.TrackerNews.net</a>, and even NPR has taken note of how valuable the site is becoming.</p>

<p>And from work stimulated by Larry Brilliant's original TED Wish, our conference poster describing our new tools for analysis won First Place in the global competition at the International Society for Infectious Diseases last December.  It's a nice achievement.</p>

<p>So, with much gratitude to Larry, we're taking the spirit of his TED Wish, his intelligence, and his humanity, mixing in a few genius engineers of our own, and adding a staff deeply committed to science, common sense, and social justice to make "Better Early Detection, Better Early Response" a reality.</p>

<p>Thank you, Larry. Your vision has shaped our work. We're quiet, of course, (like all good public health and disaster preparedness efforts), but it's going very well, we're very grateful to you, and the world is again a little better off through your efforts.</p>

Anybody with the will and access to some gadgets and a regular internet connection, can now report what they see and share it with others. Depending on how good the skills and materials of the person are, their audience can be as big or bigger than the average mainstream media. Popularity is not limited anymore by the access to media such as print press, a TV channel or radio station. Anybody (mostly) can have a voice.<br /><br />Some organizations in the traditional world of media have leveraged this new trend by using  materials contributed by citizens and having them be their 'eyes' in the scene. The process of curation, verification and edition is still in the hands of the organization.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-UBHvbQ-eVkE/TpYYSoo7m3I/AAAAAAAAAAk/_gh-q-51paI/s1600/journalism-now.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="313" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-UBHvbQ-eVkE/TpYYSoo7m3I/AAAAAAAAAAk/_gh-q-51paI/s320/journalism-now.png" width="320" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div>At the same time, several tools have allowed groups of citizens to collaborate and contribute to a repository of information, be it opinions, reports of violence or issues they've seen, quantitative data, etc. but still, the process of curation, verification/validation and editing is done by a 3rd party, be it a single individual or a group or people.<br /><br />In both scenarios, only the collection of information has been decentralized and distributed. The true act of making meaning and understanding what's going on, is still a process that takes place in a controlled and centralized environment.<br /><br /><b>Tomorrow?</b><br />Think about the typical process for reporting a story or an ongoing event. There is  a team of reporters, some stringers, maybe a few informants. Then there's the journalist that collects all the pieces and puts the story together and the editor that ask for clarifications or further details and then the process of dissemination of the news. Now think about how would it be if everybody in that team could switch their roles as often as they want, the journalist could be informant, the stringer an editor and the editor a reader. Take it even further, think about all of them doing all of that at the same time. Now suppose they don't work in the same building, maybe they don't even know each other. And now imagine they are all in different places, some are in the field, others in a office, some have access to mainstream news, others are disconnected from it but participating in the event in real time.  <br /><br />How would it be to have the complete act of journalism distributed among whoever wants to participate?<br /><br />But even more important, could they possibly come up with a story that made sense? <br /><br />Around 1910 the cubism movement thought there was something wrong with the way everybody was painting. Things were represented from a single perspective, the truth that was being transferred to the canvas was only capturing one side of the reality. It was fractional by design, incomplete by definition and ontologically false as a conclusion.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-cuM5Qt3BdcE/TpYcID9N7XI/AAAAAAAAAAs/5s4OObzc19Y/s1600/430px-Gris2.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-cuM5Qt3BdcE/TpYcID9N7XI/AAAAAAAAAAs/5s4OObzc19Y/s320/430px-Gris2.jpg" width="229" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: sans-serif; line-height: 19px;">&nbsp;<a class="extiw" href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Gris" style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: initial; background-image: none; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; color: #3366bb; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px; text-decoration: none;" title="de:Juan Gris">Juan Gris</a>:&nbsp;<i>Mann im Caf√©</i>, 1914.</span></td></tr></tbody></table><br />Cubist painters, attempted to present objects by condensing all the perspectives at the same time. A story goes, they would have a still life on top of a motorized sculpture turntable, each time the eye switched from the canvas to the object to capture a facet, a different perspective was presented to the artist.<br /><br />I believe that something similar can be done with journalism. I think that that not only the reporting work can be distributed, but <b>the whole act of creation, curation, validation, verification and edition can be decentralized and set completely free of boundaries and roles</b>. My opinion is that by de-structuring the process a much richer and complete picture could be formed and a more useful and truth story could arise.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-OJ4T4dHmkfQ/TpYYQR8OpvI/AAAAAAAAAAc/lJD0hmJBlb8/s1600/journalism-tomorrow.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="276" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-OJ4T4dHmkfQ/TpYYQR8OpvI/AAAAAAAAAAc/lJD0hmJBlb8/s320/journalism-tomorrow.png" width="320" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div>How would this look like? How would a cacophony of everybody saying everything about anything at the same time be avoided?<br /><br />First, we need to break the information reported in small bits or bites. It's much more difficult for anybody to say they agree or disagree with a 3000 words article. There will be things that you agree on, others you might not be sure, and some you might fiercely oppose. If the fact you are confronted with is a short sentence, it's much more easy to define where you stand with respect to it. Plus, you don't run the risk of throwing the baby out with the bathwater. <br /><br />Here's where the hip 140-characters information bits come in handy. If the whole story is composed out of 140-characters-long pieces, the process of refuting, discussing, confronting, denying or confirming parts of the story becomes much more manageable. And distributable.<br /><br />Now let's say there are ways that those pieces can be related to each other. Causality could be one relation, correlation could be other. Other connections between those pieces could expand on any axes of the information contained, such as who, why, when, where, etc. <br /><br />A wide number of channels to report information abound: anybody with access to the internet through a computer or a mobile device, or a text-message enabled phone could contribute with bits of information. <br /><br />Let's add now a system on the reception side of this process that basically acts as the aggregator and information conduit of these information bites. If somebody reports something in Lima, Per√∫, the system will send it to other users in the same region and ask them to confirm it, deny it or expand on it. The system could help anybody reporting in the field through text-messages to create the nodes of information pieces by expanding in the desired axes. A dialog between the citizen and the system could go like this:<br /><br />Citizen:  "There are shootings going on in Lima", <br />System:  "Do you know when it started?"<br />Citizen: "12:35 am"<br />System: "Do you know what caused it?"<br />Citizen: "Police trying to crack down on a drug deposit"<br /><br />Or the citizen could proactively submit different connected bits without the dialog with the system. Or he could simply submit unconnected information bits and others could help relate those. There are a number of design alternatives that need to be analyzed.<br /><br />Anybody interested in a specific region or topic could be subscribed and be notified when new bits are reported. He could participate in the story creation by adding other information bits, refuting some of the reported bit or creating new relationships among the different nodes that compose the story.<br /><br />As the cubist turntable, the system would act as a "perspective turntable", making sure everybody has a voice in the story elicitation process, and that all angles, conflicting opinions, facts, dates and places are combined and linked in a network that can be easily navigated by people trying to understand the story.<br /><br />This is by no means a replacement of a well-written, carefully researched, coherent narrative. On the contrary, it empowers that process, by unleashing the potential for anybody to have access to a much richer and complete network of information pieces on which to build their own version of reality.<br /><br />The premise is that any story is made of small parts than are related by different semantic connectors and that people have a much easier job having a determined and specific opinion on small bits of information. The design of a system that would allow this distributed network of participants to create this graph of information bites is the task ahead. <br /><br />We have some ideas on how this could be done, and we want to involve others to contribute and work with us in exploring such a possibility. <br /><br />For this purpose, we submitted an <a href="http://www.changemakers.com/citizenmedia/entries/truebites"><span id="goog_808435028"></span>entry to an Ashoka Changemakers competition<span id="goog_808435029"></span></a>.

Imagine you are responsible for ICT (Information and Communication Technology) of a ministry of health or hospital wanting to modernize to improve patient outcomes or disease detection. Where do you start? What could work and what won‚Äôt, for you? What is reliable? What is the fine print?</p>  <p>Unfortunately, this is not just because of a rapid pace of innovation in technology, or the extreme conditions in which these health solutions have to exist.</p>  <p>Some of the confusion is ‚Äìunwillingly- created and perpetuated by the same organizations that are trying to help in the space. This includes international organizations, academia, NGOs, funders, open technology groups, private tech vendors, etc. Types of issues I‚Äôve run into first-hand include:</p>  <ul>   <li>Academic projects that collect data with preference towards information that will help to publish a paper rather than the information that will be the most actionable or help community health the most. The project rarely fits in with other technologies already deployed.</li>    <li>Funders that sponsor the construction of&#160; specialized, one-off, disease-specific systems, that are built from scratch even if architecturally they are the same as other specialized, one-off, disease-specific projects.</li>    <li>Technology vendors fostering ‚Äòdata sharing‚Äô projects where the data ends up shared but, unfortunately, ‚Äòowned‚Äô by the vendor.</li>    <li>Open technology projects that would rather accrete features or add cool gizmos that attract users into a do-it-all system rather than open up information and let the data flow around to other applications.</li>    <li>Groups that would rather implement anything new, now, regardless of what already works, than to help a developing country figure out what they really need.</li> </ul>  <p>Some of organizations are fortunately waking up to these issues and starting initiatives to reduce their occurrence. A key component of these initiatives is to bringing in an <strong>architectural approach</strong> to the evaluation, planning, implementation and assessment of ICT needs. And fortunately these organizations have people that both know the problem space and have worked as architects in other contexts.</p>  <p>By an ‚Äòarchitectural approach‚Äô I mean an approach that:</p>  <ul>   <li>Separates the discussions of capability from implementation. e.g. a medical record system is a capability a hospital needs, OpenMRS or OpenVISTA are two implementation alternatives that could fulfill that need.</li>    <li>Understands the role of standards in supporting interoperable building blocks that can evolve over time, not as an end in of itself.</li>    <li>Helps transition the end goals, requirements and capabilities of the overall health system&#160; - the ‚Äòbusiness‚Äô architecture - into ‚Äòtechnology‚Äô, ‚Äòintegration‚Äô and ‚Äòinfrastructure‚Äô architectures that only exist to support the end goals.</li>    <li>Navigates the tension between the potential benefits of centralized, top-down decision making around ICT versus the potential benefits of decentralized, bottoms-up decision making.</li> </ul>  <p>What would it look like from the perspective of an implementer if the eHealth/mHealth community took such an approach? Here are some things you could imagine:</p>  <ul>   <li>You would get something like a capability map, a set of boxes with labels and lines that describe common elements of an eHealth countrywide health information system (HIS), including capabilities such as medical records, biosurveillance, pharmacy stock management, etc.</li>    <li>You would be able to write on this map which capabilities you have implemented (digitally or not), and for each capability get some performance metrics that can help you rank its effectiveness. For example, a biosurveillance component would assess the timeliness and completeness of reports. Your capability maps would help you do an assessment against this metrics, letting you see your maturity, and your weak spots. This assessment by itself is a huge asset for a country and funders, as it lets you understand the landscape before you aim your efforts. </li>    <li>Using the same taxonomy of capabilities, a technology team should be able to find open source solutions, papers, and case studies that describe if/how the capability can be improved. Ideally, these case studies should roll up to a community-maintained pattern library, that describes the distilled ‚Äúsolutions to a problem in a context‚Äù that have been discovered previously.</li>    <li>Any improvements can be measured over time and pilots can be assessed objectively as to how much they contribute to the goals of the country (currently, organizations running pilots set up their own measures and they aren‚Äôt always traceable to the measures a host country cares about). </li>    <li>Funders could work together helping implement solutions that work together and not on a per-project, per-disease basis.</li>    <li>Finally, any local innovations could be tracked and published against that map, helping discovery by others wanting to implement it elsewhere, contribute code, etc. Assisting the discovery and amplification of bottom-up ideas is critical as the eHealth space is very much giving its first steps.</li> </ul>  <p>So an architectural approach makes it easier to implement, build and fund technology for eHealth. So let‚Äôs look at what holds this space back and some potential issues that may crop up by rushing in. </p>  <h3>Pitfalls of an architectural approach</h3>  <p>These pitfalls are not inherent to any and all architecture efforts, rather, they are risks that can be managed and mitigated. I am sharing them because I‚Äôve seen these sap energy out of what otherwise could have been a great contribution:</p>  <li><strong>1. One Size Fits All / Blueprints with no context: </strong>I‚Äôve seen architecture efforts fail because they create blueprints that don‚Äôt consider the target context. Think about why a city apartment is different from a beach house, even if they have a lot in common. mHealth solutions will vary country to country due to factors such as different mobile penetration, language and literacy, cultural factors, population distributions. A good architectural approach would consider context as a first-class citizen. A great investment would be to evolve pattern languages for the eHealth/mHealth space, because they inherently bring in context to the equation. This is tough, however, because understanding context requires experience and on-the-ground presence which is expensive, and requires time, and takes away the illusory charm of cookie cutter answers.</li>  <li><strong>2. ‚ÄúBest practices‚Äù advertised while the paint is still wet: </strong>There is a huge hunger for best practices. In a new field as mHealth, things that work once get a lot of press. I always recommend focusing on proven practices rather than best practices, and evaluating on impact metrics (e.g. birth complications averted) rather than proxy measures such as adoption or usage metrics (‚Äú30 users‚Äù) or satisfaction (‚Äúso-and-so is thrilled‚Äù). The latter is especially tough because impact metrics may take months or years to budge, and while subjective evaluation is critical, many organizations work heavily with per diems that distort the value proposition of an effort (For those of you not familiar with the term, a per-diem boils down to compensation as in ‚ÄúIf you come and [work with my project] for a day we‚Äôll pay your staff $5 each‚Äù. Everyone would agree it‚Äôs hard to design compensation for ‚Äòcustomers‚Äô that doesn‚Äôt create conflicts of interest). A good catalog of solutions would be transparent about the impact metrics and evaluation timeframes (it ran for a week, it ran for a year) of implementations or pilots (unfortunately there are a lot of systemic disincentives on all parties involved to publish this information raw).</li>  <li><strong>3. Star charts for the high priests</strong> it is common to see an architecture effort devolve into a debate about frameworks, representation and notation, a debate with language and artifacts that only ‚Äòa chosen few‚Äô can understand. Be wary if you see UML diagrams with OCL expressions, or diagrams that claim code generation as a goal. Notations are only useful if they help comprehension. <img title="Boxes and lines yay! Make sure the stakeholders can use the artifacts, not just a chose few" style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; display: inline; margin-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="170" alt="Boxes and lines yay! Make sure the stakeholders can use the artifacts, not just a chose few" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_U5QZ4rdJlA4/SiyLFZOnvoI/AAAAAAAAASo/FRGlxNEBED0/image%5B14%5D.png?imgmax=800" width="244" align="right" border="0" /> And don‚Äôt be fooled ‚Äì UML and any specialized notation has been used many times to hide bad thinking behind a veneer of formality. A good architecture effort would communicate in a language and notation that is simple even if not formal. Even better, it would provide a reference architecture and reference implementations as a starting point for common scenarios (‚ÄúShow me‚Äù. Heck, you could even have virtual machines with things deployed and running). In my experience a good set of documents outlining tradeoffs and decision points go a long ways helping implementation, more than a complete Zachman or TOGAF analysis or detailed BPEL workflow.</li>  <li><strong>4. Shipping technology versus building capacity</strong> a good effort would specify the relevant skills and communities needed to implement technologies, and pointers on how to get those skills, not just to consulting organizations who can drop-ship products that do the job. For an effort to be sustainable, your users have to understand the goals that the technology supports, and your IT staff needs to understand the technology better than superficially. National or regional labs like InSTEDD innovation labs would be a great asset to the ecosystem of eHealth initiatives.</li>  <li><strong>5. Architecture antipatterns</strong>. &quot;an anti-pattern is something that looks like a good idea, but which backfires badly when applied.&quot; (<a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?JimCoplien" >Jim Coplien</a>). Sounds obvious one should avoid them but some antipatterns are like flypaper, one keeps getting stuck on them, and they aren‚Äôt well documented. Architecture efforts that rely on heavy top-down prescription are very prone to recommending antipatterns as they don‚Äôt have immediate feedback loops.<img title="Antipatterns are a bit like icebergs: you know they are out there, you can navigate around them if you are watching out for them, but folks are too embarassed to document any close encounters with one" style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; display: inline; margin-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="125" alt="Antipatterns are a bit like icebergs: you know they are out there, you can navigate around them if you are watching out for them, but folks are too embarassed to document any close encounters with one" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_U5QZ4rdJlA4/SiyLFuKFLdI/AAAAAAAAASs/-G1jxF18nrY/image%5B20%5D.png?imgmax=800" width="183" align="left" border="0" /> To discover these troublemakers early and nip them in the bud, watch out for designs that make sense to engineers but don‚Äôt make as much sense to user; or ‚Äògrafting‚Äô that work in other contexts. e.g. A common antipattern is recommending single-master centralized data repositories for information that spans many sectors or agencies. Another one is assuming a process or technology that works for 2 weeks for 20 people can scale to a national rollout. Good architecture guidance would have appropriate risks associated with each capability, validated by real case studies.</li>  <li><strong>6. The Master Data Model</strong> (capitalization required). This is a common antipattern, but it deserves its own bullet. The pitfall is assuming you can model the data of a domain a priori, share it across organizations and applications, and then implement software following that model. (e.g. A patient has a first name, a last name, date of birth‚Ä¶) It is possible but very inefficient to do things this way. Creating master data models is a huge temptation amongst folks who have reductionist/mechanist perspectives (and not much enterprise-scale software deployment experience). History has shown that small, flexible standards that can be used together tend to survive longer than larger, holistic standards that cover too much. Think microformats, on standard protocols. Model the interoperability that emerges on the internet, not in large companies. Empower your users to evolve their data models and workflows without having to call coders (if that is too hard, at least make sure local, in-country developers can change and deploy the software)</li>  <li><strong>7. Filtering innovation out</strong> The desire to rationalize efforts to save resources can lead to de-duplication initiatives. Reducing duplication can save waste but can also stifle innovation by reducing the chances of discovering new ways of doing things. Many great innovations are recombinations and integrations of things that existed before. A good architecture effort should celebrate multiplicity of approaches and implementations‚Äì a better gene pool is more likely to succeed. People shouldn‚Äôt be as worried about duplication of effort as they should be about lack of interoperability between projects. That said, the amount of tech efforts in the field that I‚Äôve seen that are <em>funded </em>to be duplicative from day one is staggering, but only depressing when you consider how many don‚Äôt interoperate with much at all (sometimes even on purpose).</li>  <li><strong>8. The ‚Äúopen clique‚Äù</strong>&#160; Any architecture is a like a small language, and any architecture creates an asymmetry, of those who know about it, understand it and are behind it and those who don‚Äôt know about it or aren‚Äôt quite up to speed. The health and humanitarian space is small and cliques form much more easily than in the commercial space. <img title="Architecture can be used to manipulate. It is critical to keep efforts open and the consortiums diverse. (Puppeteer&#39;s hand image credit The Godfather logo)" style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; display: inline; margin-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="98" alt="Architecture can be used to manipulate. It is critical to keep efforts open and the consortiums diverse. (Puppeteer&#39;s hand image credit The Godfather logo)" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_U5QZ4rdJlA4/SiyLFyLyP8I/AAAAAAAAASw/CEoYVMa14zQ/image%5B26%5D.png?imgmax=800" width="180" align="right" border="0" /> An honest architectural approach would be open, and would allow critique, revision and aggregation by parties not involved in creating the original architecture documents. I like the Health Metric Network‚Äôs approach to this.</li>  <li><strong>9. Forgetting about your users</strong> For a project to be successful you need to understand user priorities and how they experience technology. How many technologies have been inflicted on users because they have the right technical specifications with little regards for the user experience? How many of these technologies that users don‚Äôt like have succeeded? With mobile applications, there are many many settings and kinds of users for technology. Making things user-friendly takes more work, especially in the field. User Experience (UX) design plays a critical role in determining how technology can help the users achieve their goals. Yet I have always been amazed how most enterprise architecture frameworks miss user experience and design (or confuse it with usability and requirements gathering). Most arch frameworks are evolutions of mainframe- and client/server-&#160; era learnings generalized and repackaged for the slowly changing architectural and organizational styles used in enterprises. Consider that enterprises can afford to inflict badly designed technologies on their users much more than a ministry of health in a developing country, so I think they are a terrible role model for this particular aspect.</li>  <li><strong>10. Forgetting it‚Äôs about community health</strong> the health space is littered with technologies and standards that evolved from secondary goals of the industry, that happened to be better funded for IT. E.g. standards for medical record exchange that evolved out of billing reports needed for insurance, or auditing systems that track liabilities of health care organizations but not patients or doctors. Keep the end goal in mind! A good architecture effort would make sure the outcomes and impact are correctly placed. Standards would be chosen based on how well they fit a problem, and catalogued as an implementation choice.</li>  <p>I hope this doesn‚Äôt sound as complaining. Rather, I am proactively sharing experience for which I have first-hand scars, after having worked in the enterprise architecture space for many years. Actually I‚Äôve been coming back and again the idea of drafting a book on technology patterns for developing countries to share this, but would like to make it a collaborative effort. It is simpler to point out pitfalls than to steer a course that avoids them, but that was not the point of this post. Also, any architecture is a starting point, not an endgame that does the decision-making job for you: it is place from which to begin the conversations. Even with the best architecture efforts, the responsibility of coming up with the right solutions is with the implementers.</p>  <h3>The landscape is improving</h3>  <p>Here are some efforts I like because I think they are taking the right steps to creating long-lasting value.

I think that will help us build technology with sustainability in mind.</p>  <p>..&quot;Sustainable technology&quot;?</p>  <p>The notion of sustainability - as in sustainable agriculture, sustainable manufacturing, sustainable architecture, etc - applies to technology as well. </p>  <p>It is possible to throw money at a problem with the best of intentions and have very little impact in the long term, or leave things even worse than at the beginning. But one can build a structure of skills, knowledge and capital that folks can use to grow initial efforts into greater, unexpected things. Sustainable technologies can continue to exist for a longer period of time beyond an initial flurry of activity without drawing more from its environment than it gives back.</p>  <p>Technology ventures have many ways of becoming sustainable. From the economic sustainability perspective, for example, one way is to become a commercial product which attracts enough revenue to maintain a team that keeps the product alive and relevant to its users for enough time. Another way is to 'release' the products into open source and allow an open community influence or take over the direction. At InSTEDD we are publishing our work as open source and free services because it makes sense as a long-term strategy to serve the regions we work in. I think there's a knowledge base to be shared amongst non-profits and their beneficiaries about building and deploying technology with sustainability in mind, a library of patterns and case studies about what works and what doesn't in the long run.</p>  <p></p>  <div class="wlWriterSmartContent" id="scid:84E294D0-71C9-4bd0-A0FE-95764E0368D9:44e64510-c672-4df4-9a8b-448fdd23ba29" style="padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-left: 0px; float: right; padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; width: 304px; padding-top: 0px"><a href="http://maps.live.com/default.aspx?v=2&amp;cp=10.57422~105.4688&amp;lvl=4&amp;style=r&amp;sp=aN.11.56076_104.9194_BarCamp!_&amp;mkt=en-US&amp;FORM=LLWR" id="map-a8ea5c32-f4d0-42c8-8fb3-040054511455" alt="Click to view this map on Live.com" title="Click to view this map on Live.com"><img src="http://lh3.google.com/edujez/R-BSVekRdcI/AAAAAAAAADk/hkWPXlZPoBM/mapcc6f62747022?imgmax=800" width="304" height="235" alt="Map image"></a></div> I believe that being a 'good neighbor' and participating in the local IT community helps create products that work better, accelerate discovery of related local work, and provide opportunities for folks to get involved with the systems that are being used to improve their own countrywide health.   <p></p>  <p>We'll be posting updates, and discussing topics that we expect will come up as BarCamp takes shape. </p>  <p>Hope to see you in Phnom Penh!</p>  <div class="feedflare">

Roads, provinces, bridges, fuel pumps, it all got captured by hand in Google Earth and saved as KML files. By the time I got it, Kersten's KML had grown to be 11 MB, an amazing amount of information patiently collected and edited, and periodically shared online with all those working to improve the region.<a href="http://lh6.ggpht.com/edujez/SCM-I0Y_RgI/AAAAAAAAAGc/zpbXoRXXy4c/s1600-h/image3.png"><img style="border-top-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px" height="192" alt="Gooogle Earth with Kersten&#39;s Epic KML" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/edujez/SCM-PEY_RhI/AAAAAAAAAGk/EiSX6Mvu6QI/image_thumb1%5B1%5D.png?imgmax=800" width="451" border="0" /></a></p>  <p><a href="http://lh3.ggpht.com/edujez/SCM-gEY_RiI/AAAAAAAAAGs/svZIX8QIHDU/s1600-h/image7.png"><img style="border-top-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px" height="137" alt="Google Earth, by default" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/edujez/SCM-iEY_RjI/AAAAAAAAAG0/J7y7Km96TQ0/image_thumb4.png?imgmax=800" width="244" align="right" border="0" /></a>Contrast the map above showing the CAR KML with the map on the right showing the same region as seen by default in Google Earth.

This adapter would allow a team of people edit a KML file and then 'synchronize' it with all the others. For example, I could add a pushpin saying a bridge is down, and you could be editing another pushpin or moving it around to represent that a logistics truck has moved. When we synchronize, the truck moves around in my KML and the broken bridge appears in yours. </p>  <p>This could be synchronized peer-to-peer (a KML on your disk to a KML on a USB drive or someone else's box) as well as via a 'cloud' web service. Note this is changing the data inside the KML, it is not just 'file sharing'. The adapter knows about KML and keeps track of versions of fine-grained elements (pushpins, placemarks, polygons) inside the same file. It is an example of how a data mesh could be used to synchronize fine-grained data between applications.</p>  <p><a href="http://lh5.ggpht.com/edujez/SCM-lkY_RkI/AAAAAAAAAG8/n0L_lrQq0dc/s1600-h/image%5B1%5D.png"><img style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="307" alt="The wonderful KML Sync Demo UI, version 0.000001" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/edujez/SCM-oEY_RlI/AAAAAAAAAHE/slq5jVubAyg/image_thumb.png?imgmax=800" width="198" align="right" border="0" /></a>We chose <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/kml/documentation/kmlreference.html" >KML</a> for this adapter as it is a standard (&quot;OGC KML&quot;) that is widely used and supported by Google Earth (of course), <a href="http://www.gearthblog.com/blog/archives/2007/10/microsoft_virtual_earth_supports_ba.html" >Microsoft Virtual Earth</a>, as well as nice tools that work offline and can be used in the field such as <a href="http://www.terragotech.com/solutions/geopdftoolbar.php" >GeoPDF</a>.</p>  <p>We have a sample UI (shown here) to let you play around with the basics. The effort is still on the libraries and we don't have a neat UI to let you choose endpoints or resolve conflicts, but all will come in due time. Other restrictions include having to put your placemarks in a &quot;Shared Items&quot; folder in your KML, and styles don't get replicated. We foresee no problems working out these constraints over the coming weeks.</p>  <p>To try it out, make sure you have Java installed and:</p>  <ol>   <li>Get the sample application from <a title="http://code.google.com/p/mesh4x/downloads/list" href="http://code.google.com/p/mesh4x/downloads/list">http://code.google.com/p/mesh4x/downloads/list</a> </li>    <li>Double click on <strong>mesh4j-KML-DemoApp.jar</strong></li>    <li>Point to a KML or open the sample ones</li>    <li>Edit the location of Sample Pushpin 1 in File 1</li>    <li>Add a new pushpin in File 2</li>    <li>Press synchronize, and after both files should have the updated Sample pushpin 1 AND the new pushpin!</li> </ol>  <p>Another advantage of a data mesh is that endpoints can be heterogeneous, as long as you do the appropriate mapping. Eventually you will be able to sync a spreadsheet with columns such as Title/Description/Lat/Long into KML pushpins and back quite easily.</p>  <p>We hope to be showing this at Where 2.0. A lot of the team has been focusing on supporting the Myanmar disaster relief, so progress this week has been a bit random, but we still want your feedback!</p>  <p>Learn more about Kersten's Work in CAR at <a href="http://www.hdptcar.net">www.hdptcar.net</a>, or get <a href="http://hdptcar.net/files/googleearth/CAR.kmz" >Kersten's latest epic KML</a>.</p>  <p>See the Mesh4x project at <a href="http://mesh4x.org">http://mesh4x.org</a></p>  <div class="feedflare">

It tells the story of the rapidly spreading pandemic with high mortality following the perspective of different players throughout their work investigating, communicating about, and mitigating the pandemic - as well as normal citizens suffering the consequences and coping with the lack of information about what's unfolding around them.</p>
<p>The movie has an excellent plot and script that reflects a good amount of research and ongoing advice (See <a href="http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2011/09/contagion-questions-spoilers/" target="_blank">Wired interview of Ian Lipkin</a>). The movie skips the digital technology aspects (beyond vaccine development and social media) so we thought we could explain "how it's done in the real world" (or at least, how it's being increasingly done), based on real-world projects we have worked on in the last couple of years.</p>

<h2>Everyday work mitigates global threats</h2>
<p>InSTEDD's work in public health includes routine disease surveillance, maternal child health, and many activities outside what people imagine when they think about global pandemics. This is because detecting and containing outbreaks is best done at the source - in rural villages, or in overcrowded slums. With improved tools for routine disease detection and outbreak response used, for example, in South East Asia, ministries of health have detected and initiated response actions (quarantine, distribution of medications, etc) sooner. That means the surrounding districts, provinces, and rest of the world never gets affected by it - it is less spectacular, but the suffering can be drastically reduced.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Technology can be used for more than just reporting data</h2>
<p>Reporting data is what most people and organizations think about. But in the case of a pandemic so virulent as the one depicted in the movie, the earliest detection can already be too late. InSTEDD thinks outside the box when it comes to digital tools for health. We see the population could be getting improved information about how to avoid getting sick, responders could share real-time information about resources available, diagnostic data, and international collaboration could be simplified even on a complex backdrop of politics and economics. And we know that to get technologies widely adopted, they need to be designed with the user in mind, be scalable, and share information with the systems and tools they are familiar with.</p>
<h2>Get engaged!</h2>
<p>Maybe the movie inspired you to imagine a new way of using communication tools, mobiles, the internet, or social media to help alleviate and mitigate such events. Maybe you are enjoying an increased awareness of the effort of thousands of people around you that work day and night in public health, and want to contribute to their endeavor. Or maybe you already work in public health and want to be able to use modern tools that already exist, or want us to help you create something new or unique for you.</p>

Unfortunately, today there is no clear and easy way to express how you want people to use your data. In most cases, you never even get asked.</p><p>As a result I see many eHealth project implementers making cavalier decisions about data management that impact the rights and privacy of populations, patients and doctors alike. People grab, share, analyze information they may not have the rights to, sometimes even by accident. There are so many incentives to produce and move data freely: folks could use the data for the promise of big data analysis, research publications, commercial product improvement, for the sakes of efficiency, medical research, marketing, writing grants, or operations analysis. Violating rights and expectations is especially easy as these eHealth projects tend to have a bunch of players involved, each one with their own language, objectives and culture.</p><p>Unfortunately, there is a lack of frameworks and common language in which to have a discussion about rights to share and use health data. Academics do IRB reviews, but rarely understand licensing terms. Doctors use eHealth systems but are not information specialists, but typically don't go beyond clinical and public health use. Private systems may or may not have end user license agreements (EULAs), they impose a one-size-fits-all policy, and nobody reads the EULAs anyway because they are complicated, and each one so is different. Doctors in the USA mention HIPAA, and folks from other countries snicker. Governments roll out an eHealth HIV project and the data ends up in some intern‚Äôs laptop in California because he happened to help with the database system. And as you see this information flow rarely involves the consent and opt-in of the population and health providers in whom the population places their trust.</p><p>Imagine this situation: a mom shows up at a clinic and gets a diagnostic for her child. Who has which rights on the data? What about the kid? Her mom? What about the doctor who takes the test, the manufacturer of the diagnostics machine, the clinic where the doctor works, the NGO that implemented the diagnostic program, the funder that funded the NGO and bought the diagnostic machine, the government of the country, WHO?</p><p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="NewImage.png" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/-b-K_3n3-E6o/T3H518SPwDI/AAAAAAAAACg/lNgEbZXeyr8/NewImage.png?imgmax=800" border="0" alt="Imagine a mother taking her child to take a test.

It was a good chance to catch up with Nigel Collier from <a href="http://born.nii.ac.jp/">Biocaster</a> and get to hear some poignant questions from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vint_Cerf">Vint Cerf</a>, one of the ‚Äòfathers of the internet‚Äô. We had representatives of all sorts of surveillance work from anti-terrorism to meme propagation to infectious disease tracking; and there I presented a sketch of an idea:</p><p>¬†</p><p><em>What if we created a simple licensing framework that made it clear what rights and constraints go with different bits of your health data as it gets stored, aggregated, and analyzed?</em></p><p><em>If Creative Commons licensing helps a wide sharing of creative work under predictable terms that respect the intent of the creators; could a ‚ÄúHealth Commons‚Äù do the same thing for health data? What can we learn from the evolution of sharing of information on the web and apply it to this critical space?</em></p><p><br />I would like to one day be able to share information about my health on some mobile app, a wellness site, or a diagnostic procedure, and specify that I am sharing it with the following restrictions:</p><p>¬†</p><p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="HC-Me-Agg-hsNc.png" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/-E6V_NaEmysc/T3H58cKjKSI/AAAAAAAAACo/BXdKRoOpzr4/HC-Me-Agg-hsNc.png?imgmax=800" border="0" alt="What if I could assign privileges to how my data will be used? What if it was based on a legal framework shared by researchers, practitioners, clinicians, and commercial organizations?" width="600" height="405" /></p><p>¬†</p><p>Sometimes I would say it is OK to link the data to my other records, sometimes not: it all depends on the context and what it is that I am sharing. <strong>T</strong><strong>he important thing is that I am in control of data about my health.</strong></p><p><strong><br /></strong></p><p>Or, conversely, if I am participating in some survey, taking a diagnostic, or going to a new health care provider I would like to know if my data is going to be used with a forced license on it, so I can make an informed decision about whether to actually participate or not.</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">How would it work?</span></strong></p><p>The idea roughly sketched would be to:</p><ol><li>Treat personal information as data covered under copyright law, with the patient/originator as the original copyright holder.</li><li>Build a licensing scheme that grants explicit rights and restrictions to receivers of that data.</li><li>Make sure the rights and restrictions are termed right so that re-licensing and aggregation have clear and simple rules.</li><li>Embed licensing options into all relevant diagnostic and medical record platforms, as well as wellness websites, social networking sites, and so on.</li><li>Communicate &amp; advocate the framework especially building conscience in the public.</li></ol><ol> </ol><p>I don‚Äôt know if the license example I invented for the example above (linking to other personal information, aggregating, and use for health, science, and commerce) are ‚Äòthe right ones‚Äô. I would love to hear more ideas for the sort of constraints and freedoms a simple license would allow.</p><p>Maybe other terms would be more important. Are there levels of anonymization I could specify for my data in aggregate form? Are there clauses for natural disasters or crisis that would allow me to temporarily bypass privacy concerns in order to help me reunite with my family? The nice thing about the model is that it provides a framework in which to resolve these questions.</p><p>The genius of Creative Commons was to choose a few simple rules that would be easy to understand for many, instead of trying to make it a comprehensive license for all cases and preferences; a Health Commons would have to emulate that approach. Each time you see the Creative Commons icon it carries beneath it a smart and legally sound set of terms and licenses.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/1DKm96Ftfko" width="420" height="315" frameborder="0"></iframe></p><p>¬†</p><p>¬†</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Next Steps?</span></strong></p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span></strong><br />If anyone feels inclined to develop this further please let me know. The idea needs work from copyright attorneys, IP wonks, IRB data geeks, healthcare providers - and most importantly, anyone in the general population who would like to have a tool like this. I am especially interested in the licensing framework required for safe sharing of personal health information. I have seen "Health Commons" used to describe a knowledge commons with intellectual property such as genetic sequences, but I think much more focus is needed on the incoming tidal wave of integrated personal data from electronic records, sensors, and surveillance.</p><p>I think especially large funders and companies who are at the intersection of humanitarian field work and scientific investments need to improve their frameworks to make sure their programs have an ethical approach to protecting rights of their beneficiaries. In the meantime, maybe they should get into the mindset that they are just storing borrowed copyrighted information...</p><p>Please leave comments if you have an opinion on the topic.</p><p><a href="http://creativecommons.org/">More about Creative Commons</a></p><p>We use Creative Commons extensively in our work at InSTEDD.

We hope that this information sharing tool will make a difference in the lives of so many Haitians who are suffering right now.</p>
<p>EIS allows people in Haiti to report problems (missing persons, shelter, food issues) over SMS and to get accurate information by neighborhood. Thomson Reuters is working closely with the<a href="http://www.ifrc.org/"> International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies</a> so that critical information (like where medical care, food is available) will get to the general public and community organizations. After its launch Saturday night, hundreds of messages have already been sent into the system. Read more about exactly how the SMS reporting works <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE60G16420100117">here</a>. We are also working closely with <a href="http://www.ushahidi.com/">Ushahidi</a>, who are also receiving the SMS messages, translating them and posting them on <a href="http://haiti.ushahidi.com/main">their site</a>.</p>
<p>InSTEDD got the call from Thomson Reuters Foundation to go to Haiti last Tuesday night, a few hours after the earthquake. We had built the EIS <img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5427999327421912658" style="float: left; margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; cursor: pointer; width: 400px; height: 300px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_-lgim8VyY4Y/S1QgoSgK1lI/AAAAAAAAANE/adbL3TdLDhI/s400/haiti_Nico_Eric.jpg" alt="" border="0" />system last year, an extension of our <a title="Riff" href="http://instedd.org/technologies/riff/">RIFF platform</a>, and it was first tested in a simulation exercise in Indonesia in September. Haiti is the first time it is being used in a real disaster. Our EIS lead Nico flew out Wednesday to the Dominican Republic, and arrived in Haiti by Friday to support the EIS deployment. Nico and our CEO Eric are camping near the airfield in Port au Prince (pictured left).</p>
<p>On Thursday, we started translating the EIS system. We put out an email request for translators, and received responses from all over the Untied States, the UK and even from Haiti. Within 48 hours the almost the entire EIS site was translated into French and Kreyol.¬† Click on the language in the top right corner, and then click on Tomohon. We used <a href="http://lang.instedd.org/">Pootle</a> to get the EIS website translated. Thank you translators!</p>
<p>Led by our CEO Eric Rasmussen, InSTEDD has also been involved in coordinating a number of communication efforts as well, and ensuring that the resources get to those who need them.</p>

On the other hand, the scenarios we are addressing are proving to be relevant in all walks of life of the health and humanitarian space, generating an increasing demand and with it, a simultaneous increase in breadth and depth on the demand side. Exciting times indeed! </p>  <p>Of our main technology efforts (Riff, GeoChat, Mesh4x, <a href="http://trackernews.net/" >TrackerNews.net</a>) Mesh4x (<a href="http://www.mesh4x.org">http://www.mesh4x.org</a>) is the one that started getting the earliest deployments to the real world. </p>  <p>From mesh4x.org:</p>  <p><em>&#8220;The goal of mesh4x is to provide a portfolio of libraries, tools and applications that simplify using standards-based data meshes from multiple platforms and languages&#8230;&#8221;</em></p>  <p>The libraries can be used right away by developers who integrate them in their own applications, so there was no need for them to wait for a more packaged set of user interfaces and end to end experiences.</p>  <h3>Why it matters and why InSTEDD is working on this</h3>  <p>Data meshes have appealing characteristics for our users, so our contributions to the Mesh4x project are driven by observed data-sharing needs in the health and humanitarian space. </p>  <ul>   <li><u>Symmetrical</u>: They allow data to exist in a concurrent multi-master environment where updates can be applied at any node in the mesh. </li>    <li><u>Asynchronous</u>: They allow offline updates to information and synchronization with other nodes without requiring data locks, essential for occasionally connected applications. </li>    <li><u>Dynamic</u>: The synchronization can happen even in constantly changing connectivity topologies. I can sync with a server and later the sync can be done between my client and another client, who could then sync with another server if the first one isn't there, and so on. </li> </ul>  <p>This matters to us as these characteristics help information flow and data sharing even in the tough contexts we face:</p>  <ul>   <li><u>Symmetrical</u>: No organization or application has, de-facto, greater control over information than any other. Symmetry allows power to be shared equally amongst partners, in a true multi-master way, resulting in less hoarding of live data. </li>    <li><u>Asynchronous</u>: Connectivity is an occasional luxury, and the most up to date information is found where it is less likely to have a connection. Storing changes locally and sharing them opportunistically keeps information moving. </li>    <li><u>Dynamic</u>: Connections are opportunistic &#8211; you may not have Internet access at all, but you have access to local wifi networks, physical contact with other devices, etc. Data will eventually get to the desired endpoints as it leaps opportunistically between participants. </li> </ul>  <p>Some concrete applications of mesh4x in the space:</p>  <p><a href="http://edjez.instedd.org/2008/10/mesh4x-goes-mobile-with-javarosa-allows.html" >Mesh4x goes mobile with JavaROSA, allows you to sync data on your handset with no Internet</a></p>  <p><a href="http://edjez.instedd.org/2008/06/mesh4x-sms-adapter-sync-data-without.html"></a><a href="http://edjez.instedd.org/2008/06/mesh4x-sms-adapter-sync-data-without.html" >Mesh4x SMS Adapter: Sync data without an Internet connection</a></a></p>  <p>I have another blog post I should release soon that highlights the proven value of meshes and Groove in the humanitarian space, and my personal introduction to the uses of this architectural pattern. </p>  <p>But this post is about the progress &amp; directions for the project.</p>  <h3>Cloud-Based Service </h3>  <p>In the last post we mentioned building a cloud based services as a contribution to the space. The demand was for an always-online, cheap to host, simple server that could act as a storage of data and as a relay point for devices connected to the Internet.</p>  <p>The implementation was embarrassingly simple on Amazon's Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2, a dynamic and virtualized hosting environment) and S3. As a matter of fact, a single Java servlet running on Tomcat + Linux and driving the Java Mesh4 sync libraries (&quot;Mesh4j&quot;) provides the heart of the logic. Less code is the best code! </p>  <p><a href="http://www.cdc.gov/epiinfo/" ><img style="border-top-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px" height="184" alt="image" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_U5QZ4rdJlA4/SUGs80J9AKI/AAAAAAAAARA/4d3UpSM7gfE/image%5B24%5D.png?imgmax=800" width="244" align="right" border="0" /></a> We are doing a pilot with the Center for Disease control, synchronizing their Microsoft Access-based EpiInfo application, and they asked if the health surveys they were taking could be automatically geo-mapped as the users synchronized to share their information. This led to incorporate an ontology (&quot;schema&quot;) mapping aspect to tell the server &quot;expose a KML feed taking THIS as the title, description, address, and timestamp for the items&quot;</p>  <p><a href="http://taha.instedd.org/" >Taha describes the work with CDC on his Biosurveillance 2.0 blog</a> and why using mesh4x will help them extend the effectiveness of EpiInfo for outbreak investigation.</p>  <p>We will be opening this service up progressively as we test it out with initial users and tweak it based on their feedback; I hope in a couple of months to have a tested version we can point you to publicly! In the meantime, contact us if you are interested via email or if you are a developer via the Mesh4x.org code project. </p>  <p>Part of the forcing function for writing this post this week is that we've been chatting with CDC, JavaROSA, and others about these store/endpoint/mapping capabilities and I'd rather we start the collaboration early before we accidentally diverge codebases or approaches.</p>  <p><strong>Under the Hood</strong></p>  <p>This is the architecture that the server has been going towards these last couple of weeks:</p>  <p><a href="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_U5QZ4rdJlA4/SUGs-PNreAI/AAAAAAAAARE/9o4tGi_-b3U/s1600-h/image%5B25%5D.png" ><img style="border-top-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px" height="253" alt="AAaagh lots of coloured boxes! a drilldown to what the server architecture is trending to" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_U5QZ4rdJlA4/SUGs_atTK3I/AAAAAAAAARI/f7oQ2fZT91M/image_thumb%5B14%5D.png?imgmax=800" width="434" border="0" /></a></p>  <p><strong>Update APIs:</strong></p>  <p>These allow other applications to change the data in the service. A mesh endpoint allows FeedSync-style updates, but we'll add AtomPub for simpler edits via http POST and other RESTful verbs that are easy to manage from Javascript or are useful if you don't need the full power of the mesh. A JavaROSA endpoint will allow the right metadata to be exposed to JavaROSA or AndroidROSA handsets, and accept updates.</p>  <p>The GeoChat and a FrontlineSMS bridge would allow message forwarding and sending semistructured data directly in via SMS. </p>  <p><strong>Storage:</strong></p>  <p>This is the storage layer for all the data and the configuration, security information, etc needed to keep the service running. In our web-based instance, all this data is stored in S3, but if you wanted to host this in your own office or in a clinic, it would all be sitting inside a MySQL instance. As a matter of fact, all the mesh4x services' information is managed by mesh4x itself, so the actual configuration data is stored via an adapter. </p>  <p><strong>Ontology Extraction: </strong></p>  <p>Our service differs from a database in which you don't need to tell it the schema of your information up front. As a matter of fact, we would like to know as little as possible about the format of your data. We prefer to let applications change and evolve the data they use without having to ask developers to change database structures or write specific code for each case. But knowing just a little about the structure of your data helps with things such as defining mappings and filters, so we try to infer as much as we can. The Ontology Extraction component allows you to submit RDF-formed information (or XForms-based or other any other formats that has a transformer) and we keep track of (for example) what fields make up your entities. If you supply such ontologies yourself (in RDFS, or an XForm Definition)we keep it around, too (e.g. 'Patient Date of Birth is a Date/Time field' ).</p>  <p><a href="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_U5QZ4rdJlA4/SUGs_lG3rnI/AAAAAAAAARM/lpNT5nL6rFA/s1600-h/image%5B19%5D.png"><img style="border-top-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px" height="85" alt="this thingie is supposed to represent an RDF triplet" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_U5QZ4rdJlA4/SUGs_80lkyI/AAAAAAAAARQ/uG0fWTwC83w/image_thumb%5B11%5D.png?imgmax=800" width="78" align="left" border="0" /></a> Internally, we are using RDF as the default standard to represent data and ontologies. RDF has many properties that make it the simplest appropriate choice, but that would be the topic of a whole different post in of itself. </p>  <p><strong>Ontology Mapping:</strong></p>  <p>Ontology Mapping allows us to map fields and entities of different ontologies to help us make sense of your data. For example, to do nice map of your data we need a title and a descriptive summary, a position, and a timestamp associated with the entity. Which field should provide the timestamp? Which address or coordinate fields should be used to put an item on the map? How should the description be composed from from the data? Mappers allow us to do this, and in a future through the user interface you will be able to define these yourself.</p>  <p><strong>Filtering:</strong></p>  <p>Filtering is essential in a mesh where little devices and big devices coexist. You could have refugee records for a whole country in one mesh4x mesh, but on a mobile phone you'd probably only want to keep a subset of that. As soon as we expose filters it will be easy for a phone to say 'I work with patients in village X' and just sync that subset of data.</p>  <p><strong>Format Transformers:</strong></p>  <p>Format Transformers are components built to translate data into specific formats. GeoRSS and KML are standard formats for representing information with geographic aspects to them. You can see the KML in Google Earth, for example, and items would appear on the map as people sync their data to the server.</p>  <p>Transformers for XForms Models and XForms form allow us to translate the information of your entities and their ontologies into XForm formats. We see the utility and the pragmatism of XForms models as a way of exchanging records and to define the UI model of the forms users see in XForms, so these transformers allow us to go from our internal RDF-centric representations to these broadly adopted formats. </p>  <p><strong>Sync Adapters:</strong></p>  <p>Finally, you have all this data here, but you probably want to work with it elsewhere! Folks have suggested/requested the following as potential endpoints for the data:</p>  <ul>   <li>Google Spreadsheets: we have a Microsoft Excel adapter, so why not a Google spreadsheet one? Imagine creating a form, having it fill out a spreadsheet with gadgets for analytics, and then. Google spreadsheets are also great when lots of people online have to <a href="http://edjez.instedd.org/2008/05/thank-you-to-all-translation-volunteers.html" >work live on the same data</a>. </li>    <li>Zoho is coming up with lots of useful applications. Imagine synchronizing your Zoho app with a table in your MySQL or MS-Access database. </li>    <li>MySQL: a lot of websites out there -for good or for bad- run with their MySQL instance exposed on an open network port. Someone we were working with in Mukdahan, Thailand (a 12-hour truck ride from Bangkok), asked the simple question: if I give you my connection string, can you just put the data there for me? Seemed simple and straightforward, so we will line it up in front of other needs! </li> </ul>  <p>Together with running sync adapters we will have to have some user interface to schedule these updates, define mappings between schemas/ontologies, and resolve conflicts. A nice UI for this may end up taking a big pat of the project effort, so if you can reference us to open source projects that do any of this or want to contribute, don't be shy! </p>  <p>These mappings are part of the mesh too, so in a future (assuming anyone requests InSTEDD or contributes the source) you could be offline and mark an excel spreadsheet as 'shared' and when you sync, not only the data would travel back and forth, but the server itself could create a Google spreadsheet endpoint (or something similar) with the same information for others in your team to use!</p>  <p><strong>Putting it all together</strong></p>  <p>In my next post I am explaining how all the pieces of the Mesh4x project come together to help data integration of disparate systems and helping connect these applications into a synthetic whole, instead of having dozens of islands of information.</p>  <p><strong>More information</strong></p>  <p><a title="http://www.cdc.gov/epiinfo/" href="http://www.cdc.gov/epiinfo/">http://www.cdc.gov/epiinfo/</a> EpiInfo is CDC's outbreak investigation surveying tool.

The founders' vision was to build an organization that would help make the world safer by making technological innovations accessible to humanitarian and public health organizations to help them do their work better, faster and smarter.</p>
<p>Over the last 5 years, we have significantly expanded this vision to incorporate a very important element of <a href="/about-us/guiding-principles/">capacity building to ensure long term sustainability</a>. We believe our value as an organization is not to just help people <em>use</em> technology, but rather to help them develop the skills and access the resources needed to<em> design and evolve</em> technologies.¬† Local capacity building is essential for this process.</p>

<p>Channe Suy, our Product Manager at the iLab recently spoke at the <a href="http://tedxphnompenh.com">TEDxPhnom Penh</a> event. Channe emphasized to the audience that no one knows a problem better than the local people who experience it and therefore are the best people to lead the design and development of building solutions. Channe said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>I think Cambodians have a lot to share with the world and the TEDxPhnom Penh event was an important opportunity, not only for me, but for all Cambodians to come together to share knowledge and build support for each other. </em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>This event is a step forward for Cambodians to share their ideas and knowledge with the world. Unfortunately, under TEDxPhnomPenh license were only accommodate 100 people, but I think people were inspired by the idea that TEDx represented.¬† The Cambodians I spoke to were so passionate about sharing their ideas because they felt it was supporting both the individual and national development process. ¬† I will be volunteering to be part of organizing <a href="http://khmertalks.com/">Khmer Talks</a>, an event similar to TEDxPP that takes place in the local language to specifically target Khmer audiences.¬† The first event will be taking place in May and I'm honored to participate!</em></p>

<p><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5441237135442524594" class="alignright" style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; border: 0pt none;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_bCfOFHv--fs/S4MoWIS3ObI/AAAAAAAAB5s/d4cvOrLAkAE/s400/P1060253.JPG" border="0" alt="" width="219" height="165" /></p>
<p>Hans, a medical doctor out of the Karolinska Institute in Sweden, has developed a set of tools for visualizing data in a simple, intuitive, and informative way, and he ruptures a lot of myths in his moving bubble diagrams. His work on HIV, on investments in the developing world, the relationships between education and child health, and more, has affected thinking - and policy - at national and international levels. He's a phenomenal teacher, and to have him spend two hours at our iLab, talking about Cambodia to our Cambodian staff (and lots of visitors for the occasion), was a wonderful stroke of good fortune.</p>
<p>You'll get the idea below that his work with his software, Gapminders, visualizing data from statistical databases at WHO, the World Bank, and elsewhere, was engaging, thought-provoking, and a real kick-start to the Dynamic Resource Mapping capabilities we're just now moving out into the world (see the Dynamic Resource Mapping blog below). Great timing for us, explaining why REALLY knowing what you have out there is critically important.</p>
<p><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5441237029114987234" class="alignleft" style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; border: 0pt none;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_bCfOFHv--fs/S4MoP8MZwuI/AAAAAAAAB5k/FDzMXKgL_98/s400/P1060263.JPG" border="0" alt="" width="261" height="195" />To get a flavor of his hours spent with us, I recommend any one of the talks that Hans has given at TED. You can see his most recent, at TEDIndia last summer,  <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/eng/hans_rosling_asia_s_rise_how_and_when.html">here</a>. Other <a href="http://ted.com/">TED</a> talks include a little sword-swallowing. He's an interesting man.</p>
<p>Thanks, Hans. It was a terrific day.</p>

That simple action registers them in the system to receive alerts targeted to that village.</p><p><b>Every citizen, either registered or not, can report information to the system through SMS.</b></p><p>The system allows submission of raw reports through several channels:</p><ul><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">SMS</span>: through mobile aggregators (like Clickatell) or plugged-in phones. People can send information to a specific number, which then stores the message in the system.</li></ul><ul><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Twitter</span>: both streams from particular users or certain hashtags can be imported.<br /></li><br /><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Email</span>: any number of email addresses can be checked by the system and directed to specific collection baskets or inboxes</li><br /><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">RSS</span>: feeds can be checked periodically and new articles will appear in the system.</li><br /><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Web</span>: any user with permissions can post information using the web interface.</li></ul><h4>Bounded and Unbounded Crowd-sourcing</h4><p>Through the use of a feature we called "Working groups" and in combination with the "Baskets", both bounded and unbounded crowd-sourcing processes can coexist in the stream.</p><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_vWSpQpYPpFE/SzweWlICJeI/AAAAAAAAABM/4RAuwrh-Jog/s1600-h/Firefox+3.png"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 261px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_vWSpQpYPpFE/SzweWlICJeI/AAAAAAAAABM/4RAuwrh-Jog/s320/Firefox+3.png" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5421241424718996962" border="0" /></a><br /><br />Identified users can be assigned to "Working Groups" and the reports coming from those groups, can be configured to go to specific baskets. Therefore, some baskets can be monitored more often or by different people, depending on the working groups (bounded crowd) putting reports there. An unbounded basket could be even configured to be self-filtered by the same unbounded crowd and items with 10 or more people marking them as "alert" or a specific tag could then be pulled by another basket which is monitored by some agency. <br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">The possibilities are endless and it is yet to be discovered which patterns work better depending on each situation. There is probably no silver-bullet and it'll be up to the expertise of teams deploying this to find-out, share and adjust for cultural, social and political contexts.</span><br /><br /><h3>2-Selection and Filtering</h3><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_vWSpQpYPpFE/SzwZX2RyZgI/AAAAAAAAAA8/-WdfbHVyWsc/s1600-h/Firefox.png"><img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 269px; height: 320px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_vWSpQpYPpFE/SzwZX2RyZgI/AAAAAAAAAA8/-WdfbHVyWsc/s320/Firefox.png" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5421235948945040898" border="0" /></a><br /><p>Through a number of different tools, users monitoring the pool of raw reports can <span style="font-weight: bold;">filter</span> important information. The goal in this stage is to try to deal with as many situation awareness ‚Äúdemons‚Äù as possible, being data overload and context stress the most salient ones in these kinds of scenarios. These tools include <span style="font-weight: bold;">search, tagging and automatic extraction of the location</span> the text refers to. Other features that can be added to customize the experience and workflow include flagging documents, hiding them, commenting and relating them. The objective of these features is to aid in the process of collaboratively selecting useful information to initiate the editing workflow.<br /></p><p>The platform is completely modular, allowing the customization of each collaboration space, based on the balance of features vs. simplicity.</p><h3>3-Workflow</h3> <p>The system allows for a flexible and tailored workflow by the use of a simple but powerful metaphor:</p><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_vWSpQpYPpFE/Szwa1SzLDvI/AAAAAAAAABE/1wymG0DP4nQ/s1600-h/Firefox+2.png"><img style="margin: 0px auto; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 206px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_vWSpQpYPpFE/Szwa1SzLDvI/AAAAAAAAABE/1wymG0DP4nQ/s320/Firefox+2.png" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5421237554329095922" border="0" /></a><br /><br /><p style="text-align: justify;">A module called ‚ÄúBaskets‚Äù allows the configuration of a custom workflow tailored to the specific team and situation. The module works based on the concept of baskets. Each basket is a collection of pieces of information (items), that acts both as inbox and outbox. Each user in the system is given permissions to read, write, move in or move out items from one or more baskets.</p><div><br /></div><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_vWSpQpYPpFE/SzbnvMe4dVI/AAAAAAAAAAs/JPn9RIr1SE4/s1600-h/4B517B70-2354-4FEC-B6E2-67C934CF34E6.jpeg"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_vWSpQpYPpFE/SzbnvMe4dVI/AAAAAAAAAAs/JPn9RIr1SE4/s400/4B517B70-2354-4FEC-B6E2-67C934CF34E6.jpeg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5419773999577593170" style="margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 305px; height: 400px;" border="0" /></a><p>Typically, a user would monitor one or more baskets based on his role. As new items appear, he will decide what to do, act on the item, flag it as urgent, write a comment, create a new alert or translate it to another language. He would then put the new item or the edited one in another basket for someone else to do his part of the job. The administrator is allowed to configure "baskets" and determine who can put, view, edit and remove items from those baskets. Users can then perform given tasks on the articles and move them to the next step.</p><br /><em>The flow improves when people have not only direct access to information, but the benefit also of credible intermediaries to help discover, gather, compare, contextualize, and share information. (<a href="http://report.knightcomm.org/">Knight Commision</a>)</em><br /><p>Different flows can be created and tuned during a deployment, ranging from a completely crowd-sourced citizen journalism to a standard editorial workflow involving translation, editing, approval, etc.</p><br /><h3>4-Informing</h3><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_vWSpQpYPpFE/SzboUsAbQTI/AAAAAAAAAA0/7TVPgJOz8aU/s1600-h/clip_image004.png"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_vWSpQpYPpFE/SzboUsAbQTI/AAAAAAAAAA0/7TVPgJOz8aU/s320/clip_image004.png" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5419774643694944562" style="margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 287px; height: 175px;" border="0" /></a><p>Once an alert is ready to be sent out to relevant recipients, the system allows the user to <span style="font-weight: bold;">target affected population by location</span> through a map with references of clusters of citizens. The user sees a map with the different groups of citizens and the number of citizens in each group.</p><p>The objective of targeting by location is not only to keep the information relevant to everyone, but also to avoid that people in a desperate situation end up traveling to a distant location just because they received a message saying there is food or blankets there.</p><p>The alert can be <span style="font-weight: bold;">sent through SMS and Email</span>, and can also be addressed to specific working groups, like aid workers, local media or government agencies.</p><br /><h3>Technology</h3><p>The EIS system was built on top of RIFF (<a href="http://instedd.org/evolve">http://instedd.org/evolve</a>), an InSTEDD platform tool developed as a general collaboration environment for content creation, social metadata annotation, and automated analysis with potential applicability in a wide range of areas.</p><br /><h3>Results</h3><p>A recent pilot of the system in Tomohon, North Sulawesi Indonesia, in partnership with the Local Red Cross and the Search and Rescue Team, has proved the validity of our assumptions. Even if the incoming stream of reports from the field contained (by design) a low signal/noise ratio, the editorial team managed to process the information, select relevant topics and going through a quick but reliable loop with local translators could provide alerts with verified data.</p><p>A short summary of the pilot can be seen <a href="http://www.alertnet.org/thefacts/reliefresources/125907780276.htm">here</a></p><h3><br /></h3><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>We have built a tool that can handle information collection, flow and reach out in a wide range of deployment scenarios in disaster situations, providing the support for channeling information up and down as needed among a heterogeneous ecosystem of stakeholders. The system will serve as the basis for further learning, development and work on the subject.</p>";s:10:"post_title";s:48:"Harnessing information flow to empower survivors";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:255:"‚ÄòInformation is a vital form of aid in itself [‚Ä¶] Disaster-affected people need information as much as water, food, medicine or shelter.

I then became the architect with the Microsoft working on prototypes and designing approaches to foster of innovation within the company. But then...</p>  <p>I met Eric, InSTEDD's CEO, during <a href="http://www.strongangel3.net/" >Strong Angel III</a>, a big civilian-military disaster preparedness exercise. Later in 2007 I was partnering with Robert Kirkpatrick (now in InSTEDD too), Ted Okada and Nigel Snoad from <a href="http://www.strongangel3.net/mhs" >Microsoft Humanitarian Systems</a> working on one of our prototypes that was being deployed in Afghanistan to help evolve open standards for data synchronization. </p>  <p><a href="http://lh3.google.com/edujez/R9BiHbTdOiI/AAAAAAAAADE/Ovnnloi5sPU/P8242953%5B3%5D?imgmax=800"><img style="border-top-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px" height="184" alt="Ingenuity and innovation at the edge: Inflatable sattellite dishes, and quickly assembled weather-friendly shelters." src="http://lh6.google.com/edujez/R9BiILTdOjI/AAAAAAAAADM/xyZ7wuSLCfI/P8242953_thumb%5B1%5D?imgmax=800" width="244" align="left" border="0" /></a> When last October <a href="http://www.instedd.org/" >InSTEDD</a> took its current shape with Eric and Robert on board, I was presented with a great opportunity. Although I was working with smart folks across a successful company with an amazing team on pretty cool stuff, I had a longing to work in the humanitarian and health space full time. I wanted to bring in the best of technology to communities that really need it worldwide and to those who work with them. The choice was clear: I took the plunge and joined InSTEDD to lead the engineering arm, so... here I am.</p>  <p>Some of the things that excited me about joining InSTEDD besides the mission and the <a href="http://instedd.org/executiveteam" >people</a>, was how we wanted to go about things:</p>  <ul>   <li>Contributing to disaster and health information flow by reframing it as a collaboration problem. I believe in the ability of technology to augment human capability - and its proven ability to get in the way! </li>    <li>The opportunity to create a <a href="http://instedd.org/technology_field_lab" >field lab</a>. Taking the notion of &quot;If you don't go you don't know&quot; and &quot;design for the wild&quot;, mix it up with agile engineering to build and integrate technology so that can continuously adapt to the needs of communities. </li>    <li>The ability to work in a space where platforms are just a means to an end, and cross-platform interoperability part of everyday life. Our scorecard is based on improved livelihoods. We can use Linux, Google, Eclipse- you name it; contribute to stellar open source projects such as Mono or Sahana, and participate in the technical community with a strong emphasis on long term sustainability. </li> </ul>  <p></p>  <p><a href="http://lh5.google.com/edujez/R89roLTdOfI/AAAAAAAAACg/TcfzpFZg0bk/NoneOfUsIsSmarter%5B3%5D?imgmax=800"><img style="border-top-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px" height="182" alt="Board at Search And Rescue III, GoldenShadow Excercise" src="http://lh6.google.com/edujez/R89robTdOgI/AAAAAAAAACo/yes1v4bqgoQ/NoneOfUsIsSmarter_thumb%5B1%5D?imgmax=800" width="244" align="right" border="0" /></a>If you are reading this coming from the humanitarian or health space, you can infer I am a new on the block, so please be patient. I appreciate any and all guidance, feedback, recommendations, warnings, and advice you might have. If you come from the technology space, well, there is so much to be learned from what happens in the toughest environments, and I hope to share the lessons as we find them (or they find us).</p>  <p>Right now some of the things we are working on include:</p>  <ul>   <li>How to develop better situational awareness of <a href="http://instedd.org/aboutdirectory" >&quot;who's doing what where&quot;</a> and how to use that awareness to accelerate the process of people building relationships. </li>    <li>How <a href="http://instedd.org/goldenshadow" >information flow</a> can be improved &quot;up &amp; down&quot;: from the far field where SMS barely works to headquarters and back, with visualization and analysis, as well as between communities finding their own innovative approaches to deal with problems, and <a href="http://instedd.org/mcp" >&quot;between&quot; the silos of human, animal, and environmental health</a>. </li>    <li>How to take information typically consumed individually to create customized group collaboration environments. </li>    <li>What is a good mix of existing and new software, services and devices for the problems above? What is the simplest architecture that can keep it all working together in an interoperable, reliable and secure fashion? </li> </ul>  <p>Do any of these spark an idea? Please come and share it.

<p style="text-align: left;">One of the ways that we‚Äôve taken advantage of the collaboration opportunities¬† is through our work with the <a href="http://www.presidioedu.org/">Presidio School of Management</a>. ¬†What is innovative about the Presidio is that they offer both <a href="http://www.presidioedu.org/academics/mba-sustainable-management">MBA</a> and¬†<a href="http://www.presidioedu.org/academics/mpa-sustainable-management">MPA</a> programs which focus heavily on sustainability. ¬†Yes, you read that correctly. ¬†It‚Äôs a business school focused on creating positive social impact through sustainability oriented business principles! Among the world‚Äôs first and leading sustainability graduate schools, Presidio was founded on the simple premise that <em>we inhabit a world increasingly defined by our shared destiny, not our differences, where private enterprise and the public sector, commerce and the common good, are companions, not competitors.</em>¬† Considering our shared <a href="http://instedd.org/about-us/guiding-principles/">values</a>, we decided to reach out to them about possible collaborations.</p>
<p>Luckily for us, the Presidio also saw a good match. ¬†Last year, we worked with a team of <a href="http://www.presidioedu.org/academics/mpa-sustainable-management">MPA</a> students for a semester through their <a href="http://www.presidioedu.org/academics/experiential-learning">Experiential Learning Program</a>. ¬†¬†The university believes that the best way to learn is by doing. ¬†That‚Äôs why their students partner with external organizations like InSTEDD to create a custom-made project based on the unique needs of their partner. The project we chose to work on together was to develop a pilot for a Fellowship Program. ¬†With the support and dedication of the team of MPA students, we created a plan that we are hoping to implement by the end of 2013.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">¬†</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: left;"><strong>An Agile Human-Centered Approach to Internships</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">In order to expand our reach and prepare for the launch of our pilot Fellowship Program, we have decided to start off by bring on a select number of interns. ¬†We believe that there is an incredible opportunity to create a win-win partnership. ¬†By investing in an internship program we can engage an enthusiastic volunteer community in a way that supports our overall mission and vision in a cost effective way. ¬†</p>

<p>As with all of our activities, we begin with an open mind and proceed with an agile and human centered design process. ¬†We believe the most effective programs and technologies are flexible and iterative and are built on joint participation of the communities they are meant to serve. We work in incremental and adaptive steps, side by side with partners and beneficiaries, to jointly design programs and technologies that have measurable impact. Whether we‚Äôre building tools or creating an internship program, our experience has taught us there there is not a one-size-fits-all model for success. That‚Äôs why we are looking to engage a handful of interns to co-create an internship program that simultaneously¬† builds the intern‚Äôs capacity as well as supports InSTEDD‚Äôs overall strategy. ¬†We will work together to develop a personalized scope of work with a timeline of activities based on our combined schedules. ¬†</p>

<p dir="ltr">These adolescents have already learned to overcome many adversities ‚Äî a catastrophic earthquake, the constant threat of AIDS and a virulent outbreak of cholera ‚Äî as a testament to their strength and resilience to bad times.</p>

<div>¬†</p>
<p dir="ltr">Map PaP started in two neighborhoods of Port au Prince: Village de Dieu and Cit√™ Plus, training thirty adolescents to survey and map risks related to HIV/AIDS. ¬†They used mobile technologies to collect information that helps support problem solving.</p>
<p dir="ltr">They identified both positive and negative factors. Positive factors include health centers, water supply points, drug stores and well lit areas. Negatives factors include dark alleys, abandoned houses, contaminated latrines and poor hygiene conditions (garbage, dead animals, etc.). Once the youth collect this information about their communities, it is then analyzed, in another workshop organized by UNICEF and local NGOs. The objective is to identify patterns and trends that allow them to create a comprehensive program of services for the community that help to mitigate the risks.</p>

<div>
<p dir="ltr">¬†</p>
<p dir="ltr">Only half of the children in Haiti are vaccinated and only 40% have access to basic health care. Before the earthquake in 2010, the primary causes of death were attributed to HIV/AIDS, respiratory infections, meningitis and diseases such as diarrhea, cholera and typhoid fever. 90% of Haiti‚Äôs children suffer from intestinal parasites and other diseases related to water pollution and 5% of adults are HIV positive. ¬†</p>
<p dir="ltr">According to a 2006 UNICEF report, more than 200,000 children have lost one or both parents because of HIV and only 20% knew how to protect themselves from it. In addition, the poverty and political instability of Haiti has left the kids of Haiti in a vulnerable position in the face of domestic and armed violence, exploitation and abuse.</p>

<div>Over the last few years, with the advancement of technology, particularly mobile and the widespread adoption of social media, a shift has occurred in the way news is reported. ¬†Now, people turn to YouTube, Twitter and Facebook for real-time reports from the depths of the action. ¬†We‚Äôve experienced this democratization of media during natural disasters and historical moments like Arab Spring and The Occupy Wallstreet Movement. ¬†Citizen media enables more voices from a community to contribute to the telling of critical events, particularly in developing areas where under-reporting occurs and access to information is limited. ¬†</div>
<div>
<p>We believe in supporting communities in the creation of tools that improve global health and safety and that is why we are thrilled that iLab Latin America was selected as one of 11 finalists out of over 420 entries in the Ashoka Changemakers Citizen Media competition! The iLab Latin America envisions <a href="http://ndt.instedd.org/2011/10/new-kind-of-news.html">several tools that would de-structure journalism</a> by breaking the information reported into small bites. ¬†The system could be a database for both local citizen journalists and traditional media journalists to interact with each other. ¬†Citizen reporters would be organized by topic and location tags so that journalists could easily identify who to connect with for clarification and reporting. ¬†Anyone could subscribe to topics and follow along, adding their voice to the reporting process and receiving information from other citizens in their region.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>In order for iLab Latin America to develop citizen media reporting tools, we need your help! ¬†Please vote for us in the Ashoka Changemakers Citizen Media Innovation competition. ¬†The winner will receive $5,000 dollars toward the development of their tool. ¬†<a href="http://www.changemakers.com/citizenmedia">To place your vote</a>, you will need to create a login for the Changemakers site, which you can do quickly using your Facebook account. ¬†Once you are logged in, just click the vote button on <a href="http://www.changemakers.com/citizenmedia/entries/truebites?breadcrumb_type=finalists">iLab Latin America‚Äôs project page</a> and help us discover and share the true story, one bite at a time.</p>

<h4>For the last few years, CTO Eduardo Jezerski and his colleagues at InSTEDD have been working on a model for an innovation lab‚Äîan ‚ÄúiLab‚Äù‚Äîto build local tech capacity in developing countries to support projects with social impact. The first, in Phnom Penh, is now 100% Cambodian-run, producing tech solutions that not only address local needs‚Äîprimarily focused on public health‚Äîbut are so useful, they are being adopted elsewhere as well. Could Southeast Asia be the next Silicon Valley? A second iLab was launched¬† a few months ago in Argentina, so perhaps it will be South America.</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Recently,<em> <a href="http://www.trackernews.net/">TrackerNews</a></em> talked to Ed about iLabs, hackerspaces, BarCamps and creating the right circumstances for ‚Äúvirtuous circles‚Äù of good. (Article also available as a <a title="Eduardo Jezierski Interview / iLabs / InSTEDD / pdf" href="../docs/TrackerNews_iLab_interview.pdf" target="_blank">pdf</a>).</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>1. <em>TrackerNews</em></strong>: </span><strong><span style="color: #008000;">Let‚Äôs begin at the beginning with a some background. What was the spark for the iLab idea?</span><br /> </strong></h3>
<p><strong>Eduardo Jezierski</strong>: The iLab as a concept came from a ‚Äúmelding of minds‚Äù across technology and social work. My background is in technology, while our CEO, <a title="InSTEDD staff" href="../about-us/team/" target="_blank">Dr. Dennis Israelski</a>, has dedicated his career to working on global public health issues, mostly in Africa and China. Although these two domains‚Äîtechnology design and public health‚Äîwould seem to be quite different, we discovered they share quite a bit in common.</p>
<p>For both, it is important to constantly adapt to changing situations and to embrace iteration. It is a very different proposition from, say, building a car, where you‚Äôve got a standardized set of processes to create a commodity product. Traditional post-industrial organizational styles and practices simply don‚Äôt apply. Our shared goal is to push the design frontiers in tech to improve health, safety and development in low-income settings‚Äîand to make sure the improvements are real and measurable and driven locally.</p>
<p>We began by defining the characteristics of projects that have had long-term impact:</p>

When you get their copy back again, or if they meet each other, they can use the sync utility to make sure changes are merged both ways. They can also use the sync utility to sync to a server via http, by just putting the server URL in the text box. </p>  <p><a href="http://lh4.ggpht.com/edujez/SC3HeHB68qI/AAAAAAAAAIw/mEsXryVZOoc/s1600-h/image%5B26%5D.png"><img height="384" alt="You can replicate this synchronization topology today with the mesh4x KML adapter download" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/edujez/SC3HiHB68rI/AAAAAAAAAI4/tDpr1Ve4_1s/image_thumb%5B14%5D.png?imgmax=800" width="462" border="0" /></a></p>  <p>This week Juan Marcelo aka 'Tondat' worked on some refining touches on the adapter:</p>  <ul>   <li><strong>One File</strong>: You only need to keep track of your KML file now. The sync utility will add versioning metadata as needed to the file. </li>    <li><strong>KMZ</strong>: We support KMZ which is google earth's native save format (A KMZ file is really a zip file with KML and additional resources like images or icons inside) </li>    <li><strong>Sync any KML</strong>:&#160; You can sync placemarks, folders, styles and stylemaps. </li>    <li><strong>Folders and item hierarchies</strong>: We sync placemarks even as you move them around in the tree, or change the tree itself. Tondat tells me next week we'll separate placemark versioning from the versioning of where it is in the tree, so moving items around does not create conflict for the items. </li> </ul>  <p>We are also starting to update the server-side 'cloud storage' component to allow external applications to drive it. This would make it trivial to make a web app that:</p>  <ul>   <li>Lets you create 'shared maps' </li>    <li>Lets you download the KML and you can work on it offline </li>    <li>Gives you a URL to sync to with the sync utility </li>    <li>Has an online web page to see the current map </li>    <li>Maybe the page itself allows editing online? For example via the <a href="http://googlemapsapi.blogspot.com/2008/05/love-my-maps-use-its-line-and-shape.html" >google maps API.</a> </li> </ul>  <p>If you are interested in putting something like this together, please let us know.</p>  <div class="feedflare">

<p><a href="http://www.pacom.mil/web/Site_Pages/Media/News_2011/08/17-Pacific-enveavor-2011-kicks-off.shtml">Pacific Endeavor</a> is a humanitarian communication workshop, organized by the US Pacific Command, which brings together military representatives from all SE Asia, NGOs and industry leaders. Its main goal is to improve the multi-national communications in HA/DR situations, based on the premise that communication is the foundation to a successful response. This workshop if part of the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/MCIP-Multinational-Communications-Interoperability-Program/101122066602006?sk=info">MCIP</a>, Multinational Communications Interoperability Program:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>MCIP establishes a process that identifies and documents interoperability between Communication Systems (CS) of the MPAT nations in the Asia Pacfic Area. The process provides a mechanism for CS planners to effectively and rapidly establish interoperable CS arrangements to support MPAT during Multinational Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief Operations (MNHADRO).</em></p>

<p>Pacific Endeavor has had several previous editions. Last year Eric Rasmussen assisted representing InSTEDD; and last August I had the opportunity to assist to this year's event, in order to communicate our experiences with the usage of text messaging during disaster response.....</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">InSTEDD has been very happy to host the Flu Manual on our site for the past year or so.</span></p>
<p>The manual, called "<a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;cd=3&amp;ved=0CCcQFjAC&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Finstedd.org%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2011%2F01%2FFluManualv2_0_revised.pdf&amp;rct=j&amp;q=Pandemic%20Influenza%20Preparation%20and%20Response%3A%20A%20Citizen%27s%20Guide&amp;ei=ZrxmTt_xE6PTiAL5vrj6CQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNHhXUsRK3Lejp_nbvOLoWBw66k05A&amp;cad=rja"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Pandemic Influenza Preparation and Response: A Citizen's Guide</span></a>", is widely considered the best of its kind and has been reproduced in at least five languages across the globe. You can find it<a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;cd=3&amp;ved=0CCcQFjAC&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Finstedd.org%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2011%2F01%2FFluManualv2_0_revised.pdf&amp;rct=j&amp;q=Pandemic%20Influenza%20Preparation%20and%20Response%3A%20A%20Citizen%27s%20Guide&amp;ei=ZrxmTt_xE6PTiAL5vrj6CQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNHhXUsRK3Lejp_nbvOLoWBw66k05A&amp;cad=rja"> here</a>. It's currently being distributed within NASA, the NFL, the Los Angeles Federal Executive Board (the largest in the nation), WebEOC, Verizon, and quite a few other locations that we're hearing about second-hand. There have been more than a thousand downloads of the Guide since the outbreak began last week and we're very pleased it's found such wide acceptance.</p>
<p>Although this outbreak is an H1N1 variant from Mexico and not the H5N1 avian influenza from Asia that we've all been worried about for the past few years, it's still spreading very rapidly and it's killed quite a few people in Mexico. Fortunately, that level of lethality is not yet being seen elsewhere in the world but, from our point of view, preparation is easy and sensible and we should simply do it. It's good public health practice.</p>
<p>The information in the current Guide is very solid for that kind of preparation. It's been designed for <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">any</span> pandemic influenza (not just swine or avian). It gives a great look at:</p>
<ul>
<li>the lessons of past pandemics,</li>
<li>what the stages of a pandemic look like,</li>
<li>how to prepare for social isolation techniques,</li>
<li>how to care for a sick family member,</li>
<li>how to prepare oral rehydration solutions,</li>
<li>what to stockpile for an extended period at home,</li>
<li>how to volunteer within your community,</li>
<li>what measures the CDC recommends,</li>
<li>where to get current information as the pandemic unfolds,</li>
<li>how to prepare a home medical record of care</li>
</ul>
<p>and much more.</p>
<p>The historical viewpoint you can gain from the Guide is particularly helpful. These first weeks have always been a very difficult period in an epidemic as public health staff try to sort out who, what, where, how much and all the rest. In my opinion, the World Health Organization response, as well as that of the US Center's for Disease Control in Atlanta, has been as thoughtful and as measured as anyone could hope for in the current communications age. The avalanche of information is very difficult to sort and verify, yet it's difficult to have systems in one place talk to systems in another place, and it's always <span style="font-weight: bold;">really</span> hard to get information from the developing world. The public health professionals who have not slept in much of a week have our admiration and our thanks.</p>
<p>Although we publish it, the Guide is not an InSTEDD creation. It was written by two Stanford University students, Sarah Booth and Kelsey Hills-Evans, with guidance on medical issues from several physicians including David Heymann, MD (then Assistant Director-General of the World Health Organization in Geneva), Professor Dennis Israelski (previously Director of the Fellowship Program in Infectious Diseases at Stanford University Medical Center) and Grattan Woodson, MD.</p>
<p>The Guide is free and can be distributed to anyone without limitation. It's covered under a Creative Commons license and we encourage reproducing it anywhere and everywhere.</p>

<p>At the moment, WHO has established Pandemic Level 5 (out of a possible 6), though the absolute numbers of patients and their level of illness appear to be relatively mild throughout much of the world. Patients associated with Mexico seem to have had a more severe clinical spectrum and we'll watch to see whether that greater severity appears anywhere else.</p>

We're doing quite a bit, but we've been asked to keep it private so we will.

We'll be blogging about this soon, when the UI allows again the end-to-end scenarios folks expect. </li>    <li>Riff allows you to create public or private groups for collaboration around information streams by adding metadata to items, analytics and visualization capabilities. Much blogging needs to happen about this project. We have two interns for Trinity College working on the machine learning aspects of the project under the guidance of <a href="http://taha.instedd.org/" >Taha Kass-Hout</a> and <a href="http://weblogs.manas.com.ar/ndt/" >Nicolas di Tada</a> and the contributions have been fantastic. We even have an early SDK that Olaf put together while working with InSTEDD that simplifies how to build modules that extend Riff. We haven't shown because the UI has big (massive) room for improvement (in other words it's quite terrible right now in relation to the potential of the tool). Mea culpa. But folks who have seen it tell us it will be worth the wait if we do a competent job at the user experience. </li> </ul>  <p>&#160; On a side note I am off to Foo Camp this weekend under the generosity of Tim O'Reilly, where I expect to <a href="http://wiki.oreillynet.com/foocamp08/index.cgi?FooCampers" >learn a lot</a>, and after that I'm straight off to Phnom Penh to continue the hiring process and setting up our innovation lab.</p>  <div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5574076-2840735928832861176?l=edjez.instedd.org' alt='' /></div><div class="feedflare">

We even have an early SDK that Olaf put together while working with InSTEDD that simplifies how to build modules that extend Riff. We haven't shown because the UI has big (massive) room for improvement (in other words it's quite terrible right now in relation to the potential of the tool). Mea culpa.

<p>A number of health and social organizations in Cambodia are working hard to support and improve the health and livelihood of people in Cambodia. To generate a big impact for this important work, there is the need for two-way communication that can reach out to people directly and overtake the literacy barrier.</p>

<p>Through funding from the <a href="http://www.ilabsoutheastasia.org/network/spider/">SPIDER network</a>, InSTEDD‚Äôs <a href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/instedd/~3/y-eeukVNUs8/ilabsoutheastasia.org">iLab Southeast Asia</a> began the project to assist the¬†<a href="http://www.ilabsoutheastasia.org/network/women%E2%80%99s-media-center/">Women‚Äôs¬†Media Centre (WMC)</a>, <a href="http://www.ilabsoutheastasia.org/network/open-institute/">Open Institute (OI)</a> and <a href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/instedd/~3/y-eeukVNUs8/instedd.org/blog/verboice-in-cambodia/">other partners</a> in Cambodia in implementing a series of mobile-based information lines, scheduling advice systems and question boxes for women and children that complement and extend the reach of their current mass media projects.</p>
<p>InSTEDD has already developed an open source IVR system called <a href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/instedd/~3/y-eeukVNUs8/verboice.instedd.org">Verboice</a>. The objective in this project is to implement the Verboice platform to answer the requirements and needs in Cambodia. We work with partners from different dimensions of expertise, who have existing programs going on that would benefit from expanding their content and program through an IVR system.</p>
<p><strong>Training Verboice to a team from Open Institute</strong></p>

<div>¬†</div>
<p>We began working with <a href="http://www.ilabsoutheastasia.org/network/open-institute/">Open Institute</a>¬†and the <a href="http://www.ilabsoutheastasia.org/network/women%E2%80%99s-media-center/">Women‚Äôs¬†Media Centre </a>¬†of Cambodia. Open Institute intended to use <a href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/instedd/~3/y-eeukVNUs8/verboice.instedd.org">IVR</a> for their existing program on Gender-Based Violence. WMC thought of extracting IVR content from their existing radio content, but later they want to use IVR in combination with their radio shows, such as setting up quiz call-ins with their listeners.</p>
<p>We have other new partners interested in using <a href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/instedd/~3/y-eeukVNUs8/verboice.instedd.org">Verboice</a>¬†for their existing programs. The <a href="http://www.ilabsoutheastasia.org/network/ilo-better-factories-cambodia/">ILO Better Factory</a>program wants to use IVR for a labor law quiz and</p>
<p>‚Äútip of the week‚Äù to factory workers in Cambodia. <a href="http://www.ilabsoutheastasia.org/network/bbc-media-action/">BBC Media Action</a> group wants to expand their existing youth program ‚ÄúLoy9‚Äù to IVR. <a href="http://www.ilabsoutheastasia.org/network/marie-stopes-international-cambodia/">Marie Stopes</a>, a reproductive health organization, wants to use this IVR for post-abortion surveys and follow-up.</p>
</div>
<p>¬†</p>
<p><strong>ICT4D Cambodia Network</strong></p>
<div>
<div>
<p>We work with all partners to identify their use cases and content, and assess the different types and complexity of existing content. Further modifications to Verboice are made as needed, to enable partner organization to adapt it to their own design flow and content.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div title="Page 18">
<div>
<p>We also provide frequent demos and training to groups or individual partners so that they have more understanding about the system. We set up phone lines connected to a system for testing, so that our partners can design their content and test it. With the existence of this test line, we encourage and assist our partners in designing their call flow and testing the content with their selected target group, so that they could include their caller feedback earlier and revise the content.</p>

<p>Through the collaboration with OI we received a contribution of a server computer from their SPICE program. This server will be used as a Verboice server for our Cambodian partners.</p>
<p>¬†</p>
<p><strong>Development of language pact support</strong></p>
<p>For scalability of the implementation we also have been processing a partnership agreement with the telephone operator ‚Äú<a href="http://www.ilabsoutheastasia.org/network/smart-mobile/">Smart Mobile</a>‚Äù to provide phone lines for partners in the country to use to connect with Verboice. In addition, we also collaborate with other programs such as SPICE in getting additional connection with other telephone operators.¬†</p>

<p>Pollit is a free, open-source tool for conducting polls using text messages. Step-by-step, Pollit guides participants through polls and collects real-time results. Pollit shrinks the gap between audiences and pollers, taking the pulse of the people anytime and anywhere there's mobile phone service.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As an example, let's say that you need to conduct a survey about identifying the needs of a particular community so that you can help them get the resources they need.¬† Before allocating limited resources, it's important to understand the most pressing needs of your community. And no one knows those needs better than the people who make up that community.

<p>Remindem is a free and easy-to-use tool that allows you to set up a list of tips, reminders, and advice that people can subscribe to via text messages. Remindem sends important text reminders just when your subscribers need them, based on a schedule you define.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As an example, let's say that you are a first time expecting mother and you're a bit unsure about what to anticipate.¬† Mothers-to-be have a lot on their plates, and it's easy to forget details like taking vitamin supplements or showing up for scheduled checkups. Then there's the variety of little changes that might alarm a brand-new mother who doesn't know quite what to expect -- or when to expect it. Remindem can help make the road motherhood a little easier.¬† Whether you're a health care practitioner, an insurance professional, or just a worried mother-in-law, you can set up a series of timed reminders to help Mom make it through her pregnancy with flying colors.</p>

It is ready now for a little noise!</p>
<p>As we've worked on research &amp; development over the past year, we've found ourselves at once delighted and daunted by the amount of interesting and useful information on the web ? most of which isn?t available through news feeds. We decided to create an aggregator that would add a layer of context and go beyond RSS feeds, weaving together stories about humanitarian work, science, technology and ?one health? (human, animal, plant and planetary ? it is all of a piece).</p>
<p>TrackerNews is the result and it?s designed for the kind of humanitarian work we do. Now, we know that there are plenty of very good news and technology aggregators and we have <span style="font-weight: bold;">not</span> added another (in fact, we link to several aggregators in Tracker's <span style="font-style: italic;">Resources</span> section). Rather, we're using TrackerNews to highlight ideas, innovations and developments that can ? or could ? make a difference, and we do that with a little background and perspective.<br /><br /> <a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_bCfOFHv--fs/SWWoTixUdXI/AAAAAAAAAIc/Zk0x4Giv6Gc/s1600-h/Tracker-1.jpg" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5288818391121163634" style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 209px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_bCfOFHv--fs/SWWoTixUdXI/AAAAAAAAAIc/Zk0x4Giv6Gc/s320/Tracker-1.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a></p>
<p>We take to heart science fiction author Robert Heinlein?s words of 40 years ago: ?Specialization is for insects.? We understand that very few people have much time to read outside of their specialties, but we think we have created TrackerNews as a resource that delivers a much-needed breadth of perspective. We hope it becomes a place where serendipity is a regular feature; a place where specialists routinely discover relevant work in other fields, and where "need" and "know-how" intersect.</p>
<p>Science journalist Janet Ginsburg took the lead developing the site and now serves as its editor and blogger (<a href="http://trackernews.net/">http://trackerblog.instedd.org</a>). Janet designed TrackerNews with intelligence, experience, and a contact list that's terrific at helping us assess the world?s humanitarian, technical, medical, and scientific developments.</p>
<p>TrackerNews has a few twists. For example, headlines are not organized by topic, nor is there a standard navigation bar. Rather, a story on a single topic (whether news articles, research papers, blog posts, websites, book reviews, e-books, software downloads - print, audio, video) is grouped with background material in a single silver box to offer context and explain significance. This makes for a somewhat eclectic mix on any given day, but it?s designed to provide readers, especially those who tend to select themselves into ?silos? of expertise, with a multi-disciplinary perspective.</p>
<p>Take a look at this Flickr slide show to get a sense of the range of subjects covered on TrackerNews: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/33214485@N02/show">Slide examples</a>. I think you'll agree we're covering some fascinating stuff, and that much of it you've never seen elsewhere.</p>
<p>Although groups of links tend to be driven by news events, in general TrackerNews is not for reporting ?this-just-in!? stories. Nor are stories on Tracker ranked by popularity, which we think tends to create a self-reinforcing skew. Links are selected for their bearing on a particular subject and for their utility. Academic papers are sometimes included in groupings to make it easier for interested readers to see original research and find contact information.</p>
<p>Headlines start either in the green bar banner at the top, or at the top of the left column. They snake through the columns over a couple of days, exiting off the lower right and into a searchable archive. Research articles and other special content sport a red ?carrot.?</p>
<p>Scroll down ?below the fold? for the Resources section. This is, and always will be, work-in-progress, but even at this early date, there are hundreds of links. Whenever we find an aggregator that goes into more depth on a topic, we link to it and give a prominent position in the category. The mission of our TrackerNews site is to connect you to the information you need.</p>

<p>We also have a ?Custom Tracker? tool in development. Here is a link to a rough sketch.  (<a href="http://www.trackernews.net/major_event/index.php?id=67"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Custom Tracker example</span></a>) Basically, it is a DIY site map for the collective knowledge of a group or an event. The back end user interface is both WYSIWYG and drag?n?drop (think iGoogle homepage edits).</p>
<p>I'm really pleased that TrackerNews, even in this <span style="font-weight: bold;">very</span> early version we?ll call v0.1, has already generated some positive discussion on the value of the crossover dimension. People working emerging infectious disease surveillance are commenting on rapid disease detection technologies developed by electrical engineers. Human rights advocates are looking at communications tools developed to combat wildlife smuggling. The cross-pollination is working.</p>
<p>As most people reading this know, at InSTEDD we're deeply interested in improving collaboration and information-sharing through free and open source tools that we design with close input from our users. We apply that bedrock approach in everything we do. Please take a look at <a href="http://www.trackernews.net/"><span style="font-weight: bold;">www.TrackerNews.net</span></a> and let us know what you think. Send feedback to Janet at <span style="font-weight: bold;">editor@trackernews.net</span>.</p>
<p>On behalf of everyone at InSTEDD, we look forward to hearing your thoughts.</p>

The idea was to conduct a few usability tests on Geochat syntax alternatives that we were exploring.  Our goal was to simplify the interaction between health workers and the system to ultimately allow them to report disease cases in a semi-structured way. </p><br /><p>The case information always originates at the local health center level - this is where the patient comes and gets diagnosed. Most of the case reports are made through phone calls to the district level (the higher administrative level). Case details get lost when the district level summarizes the information by disease and reports the quantity of each to the provincial level.</p><br /><p>During our visits to provincial offices, we received useful feedback which ultimately led to the design of the current syntax. However, in health centers we found a few issues that needed to be solved before any syntax at all could be used:<br /></p><ul><br /><li>Most people do not know how to send SMS.</li><br /><li>Some of them do not know how to read an incoming SMS.</li><br /><li>Support for Khmer and Thai characters is not common in the handsets and carriers most people use.</li><br /><li>Even if there is support for the characters, writing SMS using them is much more difficult than writing in English due to the amount of letters in the alphabet.</li><br /></ul><br /><p>These posed a huge barrier to solve even before the reports could be collected. <strong>It was not about simplifying a syntax.</strong> </p><br /><h2>Reinventing the Wheel</h2><br /><p>On our way back from the visits, feeling discouraged over the challenges ahead, an idea arose. What if we decouple the process of structuring the report from the channel through it was sent? If you ask someone to send a telegraph, he does not need to know Morse code. In the same way, we could allow health workers to create the report outside the constraints of the tool being used to transmit it.</p><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_vWSpQpYPpFE/TBuG_CFNCEI/AAAAAAAAAB8/dtZ6hLucLKg/s1600/reporting-wheel.png"><img style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 399px; height: 399px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_vWSpQpYPpFE/TBuG_CFNCEI/AAAAAAAAAB8/dtZ6hLucLKg/s400/reporting-wheel.png" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5484125388702287938" /></a><br /><p>The reporting wheel has 3 concentric circles. The material can be paper, card-stock or plastic. The circles turn independently, so you can combine any set of values of each ring. On the left side is the value to be selected, on the right side a code that represents that value.</p><br /><p>The cover of the wheel allows you to see the values you are selecting and the number you need to report. Once the user has selected the day of the month, the disease and the number of cases he wants to report, a 9 digits number is formed on the right side which represents the 3 values selected. </p><br /><p>The user can then make a <strong>call to a reporting hotline and enter the number</strong> or send it through an SMS (it's usually much easier to train people to text numbers than letters).</p><br /><p>Additional instructions can be written on the cover to make the tool "self-documented."</p><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_vWSpQpYPpFE/TBuG_bm57fI/AAAAAAAAACE/38bcirLkb4U/s1600/reporting-wheel2.png"><img style="float:left; margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 396px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_vWSpQpYPpFE/TBuG_bm57fI/AAAAAAAAACE/38bcirLkb4U/s400/reporting-wheel2.png" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5484125395554528754" /></a><br /><p>This tool is very easy to build and can be done locally; it's cheap without being fragile; can be shared and does not require batteries. Best of all, it can be created for any language while still being language independent, that is, different wheels in different languages can contain the same codes and thus be used to report the same values. Some initial usability tests indicate that it's intuitive and easy to learn. In one particular case, <strong>a health worker was explaining how to use it to a colleague after just 5 minutes of training.</strong></p><br /><h3>Codification</h3><br />There are two issues in the codification process:<br /><ol><br /><li>Mistakes in the typing of the numbers: a typo could cause a Malaria report to be mistaken for Dengue.</li><br /><li> If multiple groups want to use the same reporting hotline for different kinds of reports such as veterinary diseases or crop yields, the recipient of the reports needs to know which kind of wheel it came from.</li><br /></ol><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_vWSpQpYPpFE/TBuG_vzCu3I/AAAAAAAAACM/M5NdKLOibnc/s1600/reporting-wheel3.png"><img style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 395px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_vWSpQpYPpFE/TBuG_vzCu3I/AAAAAAAAACM/M5NdKLOibnc/s400/reporting-wheel3.png" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5484125400974146418" /></a><br /><p>The solution for both problems happens to lie in the same trick. The codes for each reported value are selected in a way that not only allows the <strong>detection of errors</strong> in the typing, but also enables the detection of the kind of wheel used to report. With the method we developed, a total of <strong>more than 600k different wheels</strong> can be created and each can be uniquely identified with no additional information - only the 9-digit number reported is required. That means the same reporting hotline can be used to receive reports from a wide variety of sources.</p><br /><br /><p>At the moment we are conducting pilots in Thailand and Cambodia. We will soon have more to report on this.</p><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_vWSpQpYPpFE/TBuIJQIRxWI/AAAAAAAAACc/PqWaxM0pqZo/s1600/IMG_0573.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 300px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_vWSpQpYPpFE/TBuIJQIRxWI/AAAAAAAAACc/PqWaxM0pqZo/s400/IMG_0573.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5484126663783597410" /></a>";s:10:"post_title";s:19:"IT without Software";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:255:"During August 2009, we went on a number of field trips to health centers in remote areas of Thailand and Cambodia.

In this post I share the toolset we use to support the lifecycle of our technology which is effective as well as lean. Perhaps others can take advantage of the evaluation work we did or can suggest useful alternatives..</p>  <p>Our key requirements are:</p>  <ul>   <li>The tools work with our <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(management)" >Scrum</a>+XP (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_Programming" >eXtreme Programming</a>) processes </li>    <li>The tools work for an internationally distributed team even <a href="http://instedd.org/technology_field_lab" >when in the field</a>&#160;</li>    <li>They are efficient cost-wise as well as adequate for the task and reliable</li> </ul>  <p>These requirements led us to evaluate many approaches. Ultimately, we opted for an infrastructure that requires <em>no</em> <em>intranet</em>, and no on-premise servers. That means no extra staff of acolytes &amp; operators simply to keep the things going, and associated savings on power/heat/rackspace management...expenses decidedly not core to our mission.</p>  <p>I'm exaggerating. We do have an intranet. It has a printer.</p>  <p>By using software-as-a-service or software+services we have the advantages of lesser operations and increased reliability. We must also take a hard look at three contentious areas:</p>  <ul>   <li><u>Security</u>: Will the hosted service provide us with the level of confidentiality, transport security, and the management of user privileges that we need? </li>    <li><u>Data Portability</u>: Will the hosted service allow us to import - and even important - EXPORT data to another service? We didn't want to fall into a lock-in scenario with 'trapped data'. Both on and off-premise backups are a must. </li>    <li><u>Accessibility</u>: Will the service be accessible in the field? How Can it cope with low bandwidth connections? Is it possible to work offline?</li> </ul>  <p>In the end, we have arrived at the following list of tools that as a set fare well with our way of working and our needs. You can see the rough cost structure for the services that aren't free (When I say 'Free' I mean gratis/no cost/<a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?FreeAsInBeer" >Free as in Beer</a>.)</p>  <h4>Engineering Tools:</h4>  <p><strong>Google Code</strong> -<a title="http://code.google.com/" href="http://code.google.com/">http://code.google.com/</a>- We use Google Code for the source code control (SCC) of components and tools we release as FOSS . It provides issue tracking, a wiki, and downloads in addition to the source code control features. Free.</p>  <p><a href="http://lh5.google.com/edujez/R-lR7IZLmiI/AAAAAAAAAE8/AKFGnQeSIBY/image3.png?imgmax=800"><img style="border-top-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px" height="65" alt="image" src="http://lh6.google.com/edujez/R-lR7YZLmjI/AAAAAAAAAFE/OiJ4MZ_reeM/image_thumb1.png?imgmax=800" width="65" align="right" border="0" /></a> <strong>CVSDude</strong> - <a title="http://cvsdude.com/" href="http://cvsdude.com/">http://cvsdude.com/</a> - We host in CVSdude the source code for projects in their early stages when they aren't open source yet. Monthly fee.</p>  <p><a href="http://lh3.google.com/edujez/R-lR7oZLmkI/AAAAAAAAAFM/YOYY909PGlo/image7.png?imgmax=800"><img style="border-top-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px" height="67" alt="image" src="http://lh4.google.com/edujez/R-lR74ZLmlI/AAAAAAAAAFU/fNVmdxEsyfQ/image_thumb3.png?imgmax=800" width="87" align="right" border="0" /></a> <strong>Tortoise SVN </strong>- <a title="http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/" href="http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/">http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/</a> - Tortoise is the most popular SCC client in the team. CVS &amp; Subversion allow working offline - and managing multiple copies of the source trees on the client, and Tortoise allows you to manage these with ease. Another great feature is that we can keep in the same source tree a mix of projects hosted on Google Code and CVSDude, allowing developers to just do single update and commit operations. This helps us work on our <strike>embarrassing</strike> early code while keeping the open source projects up to date with no extra hassle. Monthly fee.</p>  <p><a href="http://lh5.google.com/edujez/R-lR8IZLmmI/AAAAAAAAAFc/moX3h_OV6h8/image11.png?imgmax=800"><img style="border-top-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px" height="61" alt="image" src="http://lh6.google.com/edujez/R-lR8YZLmnI/AAAAAAAAAFk/eIqlQol_Xpg/image_thumb5.png?imgmax=800" width="62" align="right" border="0" /></a> <strong>Fogbugz</strong> - <a title="http://www.fogbugz.com/" href="http://www.fogbugz.com/">http://www.fogbugz.com/</a> - We use Fogbugz for our work-item, task, and bug management. Batch updates are easy with its AJAX-based list management. It allows you to create private and shared views, exports data in multiple formats, provides email notification and reports (eg burndown charts) that are useful in agile processes. And - great for testers - it even has a client that allows you to take screenshots, annotate them, and attach them to new bugs. Finally, it has a killer feature that allows me to create new tasks <em>by just typing and pressing &quot;enter&quot; </em>(&quot;killer&quot; because its abuse guarantees my death at the hands of the engineering team). Monthly fee.</p>  <p><strong>Virtualization</strong> - Although it is not &quot;hosted infrastructure&quot;, virtualization saves on hardware costs. We run most of our work in virtualized environments which include including dev boxes, boxes running demos, boxes for testing or building. Some devs run these from XP, Linux, or Mac OS. We tend to use VMWare, which does a good job of allowing VPCs unfettered access to USB ports and such when working with special devices. Free or not depending on the virtualization product you use and the OSs you are hosting.</p>  <p>The collective annual fee of all the services listed above roughly equal the cost of one moderate-size server with no OS, no software and no support staff. </p>  <h4>Communications &amp; Sharing</h4>  <p><strong>Skype</strong> - <a href="http://www.skype.com/">http://www.skype.com/</a> - For voice, video and chat. At crunch times, our team keeps a Skype channel open -- sometimes for hours at a time. It provides a sense of literally being in the same room. We are also looking at ooVoo, vSee and N-way for video. Basic Skype is free. Additional features, such as forwarding calls to a cell phone, are very cheap.</p>  <p><strong>Conference calling</strong>- <a title="http://www.intercall.com/" href="http://www.intercall.com/">http://www.intercall.com/</a>- We chose a conference call provider that has access numbers in over 50% of the world's countries. Although costs are based on the number and location of call participants, overseas tolls are avoided, which is a significant savings on international calls.</p>  <p><strong>Twitter</strong>&#160; (<a href="http://www.twitter.com">http://www.twitter.com</a>) &quot;Micro-messages&quot; are great for ad-hoc communications, especially by SMS users spread across several countries. Within the team we send twitter direct messages by prefixing messages with <em>d</em> as in &quot;<em><u>d</u>&#160;<u>some-name</u> I just uploaded the new version check it out</em>&quot;. I use <a href="http://www.twhirl.org/" >Twhirl</a> as a Twitter desktop client. Free.</p>  <p><strong>Sharedview</strong> - (<a href="http://connect.microsoft.com/site/sitehome.aspx?SiteID=94" >Link</a>) We use this new Microsoft tool for quick-and-easy screen sharing. Drawback: it only runs on Windows. But most of us have some flavor of Windows running - even if it is in a virtual machine on Linux or MacOS. Free.</p>  <p><strong>Google Docs</strong> - (<a title="http://docs.google.com/" href="http://docs.google.com/">http://docs.google.com/</a>) We use Google docs for taking notes and brainstorming during conference calls. It allows multiple users to collaboratively edit a document in real time. Once completed, though, we copy the document into MS Word or OneNote and save in Groove, which makes it possible to access the information offline. Free.</p>  <p><strong>Groove</strong> - (<a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/groove/default.aspx" >Link</a>) Microsoft Groove is useful for team coordination, managing &quot;knowledge bases&quot; of technologies and, most important of all, for tracking user requirements in the field. Since Groove is inherently an offline tool, it shines when Internet connectivity is an issue, but local connectivity is possible. It is not a traditional &quot;cloud&quot; product, but is based on a secure mesh architecture that allows pure peer-to-peer interaction. Unfortunately (<em>hint</em>!), it only works on the Windows OS, it speaks non-standard protocols over the wire, and has no &quot;Web Access&quot;/&quot;Live&quot; component to it. It is a part of Microsoft Office Ultimate. License Fees. </p>  <h4>Still needing improvements...</h4>  <p>These are some of the shortcomings with these hosted services which we hope will be addressed in the upcoming years:</p>  <ul>   <li><strong>Offline access</strong>: Many web-based tools would be more useful and valuable if they also offered a thoughtfully-designed, well-architected, reliable client for offline usage (and it takes more than just sprinkling Google gears around your javascript to achieve this, but that's a topic for another post).</li>    <li><strong>Unified authentication</strong> - The growth in number of sites using single sign on technologies such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenID" >OpenID</a> is encouraging but more would be better. In addition, services such as access control and other crosscutting features could be added into the mix (a trend I encouraged at an <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/workshops/aop/" >AOP panel long ago</a>).</li>    <li><strong>Support for Integration</strong> - I'd like to see more sites view themselves as 'building blocks' -- as part of a larger solution instead of trying to be the 'one stop shop'. Data, process, and UI integration APIs are always welcome. </li> </ul>  <p>So far this mix of products has been working well. The increase in bandwidth, along with tools and standards has allowed us to have core engineering-mission-critical tools online, and &quot;software as/plus services&quot; a cost-effective strategy we use everyday.</p>  <div class="feedflare">

Together, we went through their workflows, had conversations with people in different roles  and discussed their tasks and responsibilities in order to find a pressing need that we could support (it is an amazing thing that more than 99% of Red Cross staff in the Bay Area are volunteers).<br /><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ZImbaujWedU/TmaKuxvkDGI/AAAAAAAAAGo/UkmK1gbJ5GE/s1600/6120607445_fec2325c50_b.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="239" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ZImbaujWedU/TmaKuxvkDGI/AAAAAAAAAGo/UkmK1gbJ5GE/s320/6120607445_fec2325c50_b.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><br />We ended up deciding that something we could do was to help them reduce the workload of the recruiting process to respond to disasters of any scale.<br /><br /><h2> The Problem</h2>Currently, when an incident is reported, the DAT (Disaster Action Team) coordinator, needs to call volunteers one by one  until they have enough people confirmed to staff the response. The coordinator uses a spreadsheet that contains a list of all the volunteers, with their time-shifts, the city they live and their contact phone numbers. For a small incident that requires 5 responders, an average of 20 calls to different volunteers need to be made. <em>That means that the coordinator spends more than 2 hours making phone calls, just to put together the team that will respond.</em><br /><br /><h2> The Goal</h2>We set up to reduce that workload and automate the process as much as we could, while still keeping the DAT coordinator in control of the aspects of the recruiting process they needed to handle.<br /><br /><h2> Watchfire</h2>Over the last few weeks, we have designed and developed <strong>Watchfire</strong>, a web application that will automate the recruiting process. The application imports their spreadsheet and stores that in a database, including their location and landline and mobile phone numbers. <br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-levALU3BWcw/TmaK6AOc1uI/AAAAAAAAAHA/nvnFzWKT6Oc/s1600/Volunteers.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="296" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-levALU3BWcw/TmaK6AOc1uI/AAAAAAAAAHA/nvnFzWKT6Oc/s320/Volunteers.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><br />Administrators or volunteers can edit the information, including their contact information, location and availability. At any point they can import a new spreadsheet to update the information.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-wYyAD_sg54c/TmaK5kKP_xI/AAAAAAAAAG8/2A4OUk2cezk/s1600/Volunteer.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-wYyAD_sg54c/TmaK5kKP_xI/AAAAAAAAAG8/2A4OUk2cezk/s320/Volunteer.jpg" width="197" /></a></div><br /><br />When the DAT coordinator needs to start the recruiting process, they enters the number of people to recruit, the category (team lead, volunteer, trainee, etc.) and the location of the event. The system then creates a calling list of the people that are closest to the event. <br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-oLgd5xeVBks/TmaK3oOHztI/AAAAAAAAAGs/uRlifhpTPxU/s1600/Event_new.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="237" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-oLgd5xeVBks/TmaK3oOHztI/AAAAAAAAAGs/uRlifhpTPxU/s320/Event_new.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><br /><br />A circle around the area where the recruiting is happening will be shown, giving the user feedback about how far the volunteers might be coming from. The user can also block some of the people in the calling list to have the system skip them. When they're ready, and clicks "Start recruiting", <strong>Watchifre</strong> starts calling people in the list by order of proximity. The calls are made to the registered phones, and the receiver hears an automated message with the description of the event, asking them if they can respond. Text messages are also sent to volunteers that have texting plans (only 50% of the Red Cross volunteers do).<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-kxsYzSsL1Q4/TmaK4sZ7UpI/AAAAAAAAAG0/bi5Q4SFBAIM/s1600/Event_recruiting.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="237" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-kxsYzSsL1Q4/TmaK4sZ7UpI/AAAAAAAAAG0/bi5Q4SFBAIM/s320/Event_recruiting.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><br /><br />As volunteers start responding, the system refreshes to reflect the status of the recruiting process, giving the DAT coordinator a list of the people that have confirmed their availability. <br /><br />Any number of recruiting processes can be run at the same time, each with it's own calling list, location, category and description. The event screens allows the coordinator to monitor the status of each recruiting process as it happens.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-rfx3fhx56ts/TmaK4-gLq4I/AAAAAAAAAG4/FdiE7xxTKZ4/s1600/Events.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="177" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-rfx3fhx56ts/TmaK4-gLq4I/AAAAAAAAAG4/FdiE7xxTKZ4/s320/Events.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><br /><br />Phone calls are made using <strong>Verboice</strong>, the voice service component of our platform, which enables applications to make and receive phone calls. <strong>Verboice</strong> supports an unlimited number of phone lines, so <strong>Watchfire</strong> can make as many simultaneous calls as lines are available, reducing the response time even further. We are using VOIP (Voice over IP) phone lines, at a $20/month national flat-rate.<br /><br />Text Messages are sent through <a href="http://nuntium.instedd.org/">Nuntium</a>, our messaging service.<br /><br /><h3> Other uses</h3><br />Needless to say, there are countless other uses for this tool besides staffing disaster responses:<br /><ul><li>Activism organizations could have their database of members and issue a call when they are having an event. People could RSVP their participation through the keypad or by replying a text message</li><li>Requests to sign petitions could be sent through phone calls or text messages and registered users of the tool could "sign" through their phones</li><li>Distributed working groups could be activated to respond to events</li><li>Meetings or event could be organized in the same way</li></ul><h3> Feedback</h3>We welcome your feedback, ideas, needs and suggestion to make this a tool that can help you with your work.

It has a simple but powerful <a href="http://code.google.com/p/nuntium/wiki/API">API</a> that you can use to integrate your application. You can use Nuntium from <a href="http://nuntium.instedd.org/">InSTEDD's server</a> or deploy it in your own machine. Join <a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/nuntiumusers/">our list</a> to get help or discuss your needs.<br /><br />To put it in a simple way, Nuntium acts as your one-stop for all the messaging needs of your applications, including -but not limited to- SMS, Mail, Twitter and <a href="http://xmpp.org/">XMPP</a>. It allows you to focus on your functionality without having to deal with all the crazy quirks of telephone companies infrastructure, SMS aggregators or communication protocols.<br /><br />It also supports the QST protocol defined by the <a href="http://www.open-mobile.org/">OpenMobile Consortium</a>.<br /><br />Every single feature built in Nuntium, is the result of a concrete need that we had during our work with messaging systems, mainly in South-East Asia -where Nuntium delivers the daily communications and disease reporting of a few thousands users-  and <a href="http://ict4peace.wordpress.com/2010/05/11/instedds-response-in-haiti/">Haiti</a> where it served as the <a href="http://blog.ushahidi.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/4636-Graphic-Updated.jpg">keystone layer</a> for receiving and sending hundreds of thousands of messages from the 4636 shortcode. So, instead of going through the features I'll present some examples.<br /><br /><h2>Share your number among many applications</h2><a href="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_vWSpQpYPpFE/TGNrY3CNVOI/AAAAAAAAAEU/HuQ6zhP0gBQ/nuntium-login.png?imgmax=800" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="nuntium-login" border="0" height="320" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_vWSpQpYPpFE/TGNrY3CNVOI/AAAAAAAAAEU/HuQ6zhP0gBQ/nuntium-login.png?imgmax=800" title="nuntium-login.png" width="180" /></a> Once you have created your account in Nuntium, you can add as many applications as you need. Let's imagine that after lots of negotiations you got a 1234 shortcode in Kenya and you need to use it with four applications. We'll call them "Maternal Health", "Road accidents", "Disease Reporting" and "Team chat".<br /><br /><img alt="nuntium-app" border="0" height="400" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_vWSpQpYPpFE/TGNrZs5FbWI/AAAAAAAAAEY/gpafui5BLP0/nuntium-app.png?imgmax=800" style="float: right;" title="nuntium-app.png" width="147" /><br />For the Maternal Health application, you decided you are going to ask your users to prefix their messages with "MH". In the case of "Road accidents", your users are 5 specific individuals and you know their phone numbers. For "Disease Reporting" you are using a mobile application that sends SMS reports in a machine-readable format. And with your "Team chat" app you don't want people to have to prefix their messages.<br /><br />By using Rules in Nuntium you could configure that scenario, and support 4 different applications, coded in different languages, with a single number for all of them. All that, while keeping the routing logic out of your apps, and making it transparent to each one.<br /><br />Rules can change properties in the message, like removing a keyword prefix or decide to which application the message should be routed. You can do simple things like matching the start of the body, or use regex expression to target very specific formats or syntaxes.<br /><img alt="nuntium-apps" border="0" height="225" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_vWSpQpYPpFE/TGN6TTk0M2I/AAAAAAAAAEs/SWpJ2O_1fZg/nuntium-apps.png?imgmax=800" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="nuntium-apps.png" width="640" /><br /><img alt="nuntium-rules" border="0" height="221" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_vWSpQpYPpFE/TGN6UNUed0I/AAAAAAAAAEw/oIr9FhZwICw/nuntium-rules.png?imgmax=800" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="nuntium-rules.png" width="640" /><br /><br /><h2>Supporting complex, emerging, dynamic ecosystems</h2><a href="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_vWSpQpYPpFE/TGNwybfxi7I/AAAAAAAAAEk/HW_DFGHIOi4/haiti%20ecosystem%20-%20phase%206.png?imgmax=800" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="haiti ecosystem - phase 6" border="0" height="222" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_vWSpQpYPpFE/TGNwybfxi7I/AAAAAAAAAEk/HW_DFGHIOi4/haiti%20ecosystem%20-%20phase%206.png?imgmax=800" title="haiti ecosystem - phase 6.png" width="320" /></a><br /><br />In many situations you might face a constantly changing environment, in which you need to switch routing rules, deliver messages through different channels according to the carrier of the recipient, or you might have to create an infrastructure by combining plugged-in phones, direct network connections to telephone companies and international aggregators. All that while keeping track of what is going on with each single message.<br /><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_vWSpQpYPpFE/TGN6U9xLq3I/AAAAAAAAAE0/7aEpu_jpW7w/haiti%20ecosystem%20-%20phase%203.png?imgmax=800" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img alt="haiti ecosystem - phase 3.png" border="0" height="265" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_vWSpQpYPpFE/TGN6U9xLq3I/AAAAAAAAAE0/7aEpu_jpW7w/haiti%20ecosystem%20-%20phase%203.png?imgmax=800" title="haiti ecosystem - phase 3.png" width="320" /></a></div>Nuntium is packed with lots of tools to do so.

They provide you with one or more numbers that you can use in several countries and carriers.<br /><br />Nuntium supports the creation of a channel for Clickatell. All you need to configure are your credentials, decide if you want to use it as incoming, outgoing or bi-directional channel and the network that you got your number in. That network determines in which countries and carriers your phone number will work. Nuntium already imports periodically all the coverage tables from Clickatell, so you don't need to worry about that.<br /><br />After doing the setup, you can either pull the messages using an RSS feed, or you can configure an endpoint in your app, an Nuntium will do a post to that URL for each incoming message. That way you don't even need to code a scheduled recurrent task to check for new messages. <br /><h2><br /></h2><h2>Using a plugged-in phone or a gsm modem</h2>A very common scenario in a mobile app deployment is that the use of international numbers for SMSing is either cost-prohibitive or just doesn't work. Getting a local telephone company to provide you with a cheap number and a machine-friendly interface to read and receive messages can take some time in many countries.<br /><br />The default choice in this cases is to buy a local simcard, get a cheap phone and just interface through a computer.<br /><br />You can also do that with Nuntium by configuring another type of channel and downloading our <a href="http://geochathelp.com/doku.php?id=advanced:localgateway">mobile gateway</a> application. It's a java app, so you can run it under Windows, Linux or OSX.<br /><br />The nice thing is that whenever you need to scale up and you have your short-code or long-code ready with a carrier or aggregator, you just add another channel and without changing a single line in your application, you are ready to go from a few messages per minute, to hundreds or thousands. <br /><h2><br /></h2><h2>Allowing your apps to interact with users through Twitter, Email and Chat</h2><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_vWSpQpYPpFE/TGN-b-uVgmI/AAAAAAAAAFE/50PNsCCR34E/s1600/Screen+shot+2010-08-11+at+6.19.38+PM.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_vWSpQpYPpFE/TGN-b-uVgmI/AAAAAAAAAFE/50PNsCCR34E/s320/Screen+shot+2010-08-11+at+6.19.38+PM.png" /></a></div>Nuntium does more than sending SMS. You can use it for any other messaging channel you can think of. Mail is supported through POP3 and SMTP, so you can just create a gmail account and start sending and receiving mails from your app. Or create a twitter account and set it up. If you want your users to be able to chat with your application or receive notifications in their GTalk, Adium, or any other XMPP (ex-Jabber) client, you can also do it.<br /><br />And all of this through only ONE interface. Your application doesn't have to worry if it's an SMS, email, twitter or instant message what it want to send. Just adding a prefix like "xmpp://" or "sms://" to the recipient address will tell Nuntium everything it needs to know to dispatch the message. You will also get all the incoming messages in exactly the same way. <br /><h2><br /></h2><h2>Summary</h2>If you need to SMS-enable your apps, or if you want to switch to something that will allow you to scale both horizontally and vertically, <a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/nuntiumusers/">get in touch</a>, we would love to help you out build a world-class app with world-class messaging powers.";s:10:"post_title";s:24:"Make your SMS apps scale";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:255:"A new version of Nuntium, is out and I wanted to share some of the great new features it contains.Nuntium is an open source and free messaging service, built with Ruby on Rails.

In the fall of 2010  he decided to conduct research on alcohol advertising visible at the street level in retail-dense blocks of NYC. <br /><br />Throughout November and December, a team of 16 people used <a href="http://geochat.instedd.org/">InSTEDD GeoChat</a> to report and aggregate alcohol ads. The team was composed of 13 graduate-level students from Hunter College, enrolled in a GIS for Public Health class, and 2 other Health Department staff members.<br /><br /><object style="height: 292px; width: 480px"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/9jyZ2IAaRUI?version=3"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"><param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always"><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/9jyZ2IAaRUI?version=3" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" allowScriptAccess="always" width="480" height="292"></object><br /><br />GeoChat is designed to work as a group chat, for sending out alerts or for reporting information like in this case. We learned about NYC Health project when Chris reached out with some questions to the <a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/geochatusers/">GeoChat Users Community</a>. We were thrilled when we heard of such an original use for the tool. <br /><br />To collect the data from the streets, they split up into 3-member teams, with one member responsible for navigating and selecting the appropriate street segments and the other two reporting the identified advertisements by texting a Geochat message. For each industry alcohol advertisement, the team sent a GeoChat message including the alcohol type-beer, wine, liquors-, brand, advertisement type-indoor, billboard, bus shelter, outdoor, ambient-and address. By typing an asterisk between each field, messages could later be broken up into columns. The <a href="http://geochathelp.com/doku.php?id=phone:gettingstarted:report_position">geocoding functionality</a> of GeoChat automatically assigns coordinates to each message containing an address, leaving the information ready to be mapped. <br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-YXJ94gGTb_w/TlQOYGdeUgI/AAAAAAAAAGA/ofdV6jVmeJU/s1600/Screen+Shot+2011-08-23+at+1.07.08+PM.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="270" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-YXJ94gGTb_w/TlQOYGdeUgI/AAAAAAAAAGA/ofdV6jVmeJU/s320/Screen+Shot+2011-08-23+at+1.07.08+PM.png" width="320" /></a></div><br />Messages sent by a data collection team looked like the following: 100 Worth Street * indoor * beer * [beer brand name].<br /><br />GeoChat allows all the messages in a group-including the geographic coordinates, date and time-to be exported in standard formats, so the team could map their data and analyze it using <a href="http://www.esri.com/software/arcgis/index.html">ArcGIS</a> (a geographic information system).<br /><br />Of the 30 sampled zip codes, 27 (90%) had alcohol advertisements on at least one of the retail- dense blocks sampled. Of the 312 blocks sampled, 122 (39%) had at least one alcohol ad.

<p dir="ltr"><strong>Abortion in Cambodia</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Unsafe abortion accounts for one in eight maternal deaths in developing countries. Although abortion was legalized in Cambodia in 1997, nearly 80% of Cambodian women still believe that abortion is illegal. ¬†A combination of a lack of understanding of the laws and desperation forces many women to risk their lives by having unsafe and dangerous abortions by unregistered providers. ¬†</p>
<p dir="ltr">National health surveys suggest that nearly a quarter of Cambodian women have had one or more abortions. Over 50% of these women do not use a reliable method of post abortion family planning, and around 25% will have a repeat abortion within five years. ¬†With over 25% of all maternal deaths in Cambodia being the result of unsafe abortions, access to safe abortion services and an emphasis on post abortion family planning is essential to reduce these statistics. ¬†</p>
<p><em>‚ÄúWomen are embarrassed about having abortions and often terminate them with someone who will keep it a secret, but might not be trained properly‚Äù</em>¬†says Sa Usah, a 24 year old beer garden waitress in Siem Reap and¬†<a href="http://www.mariestopes.org.kh/" >Marie Stopes International Cambodia</a>¬†peer volunteer.¬† Despite abortion having been legalized in Cambodia for over 13 years, a study conducted in 2009 found that 80% of women who accessed abortion services believe abortion is against the law. As Usah points out; this common belief forces women to turn to unsafe, unregistered providers which puts woman at risk of morbidity or at worst mortality, contributing to the high rates of maternal mortality in Cambodia.

<p>Over the last decade, mobile phone use in low-income countries has skyrocketed. In fact, it‚Äôs the fastest growing sector of the communications industry. ¬†In Cambodia, over 13 million people, which is nearly 90% of the population, have or use a mobile phone. ¬†Telecommunications companies claim that there is a near total network coverage across the country. ¬†</p>

Many friends are either already there or on their way to help as part of UNDAC teams. It's a tough situation in a tough context, and all my hopes reach out to the communities there so they can recover soon. Unfortunately, it won't go back to &quot;normal&quot; for a long time, if ever. I was in Peru last week and the August '07 earthquake still defines how people live in Pisco. The press and much of the aid has left and the town is still...leveled. Throw in a major disaster in a non-resilient environment, with a bunch of foreign aid with varied commitments to the region, and the long term outcomes are very hard to predict.</p>  <p>This week we made significant updates in <a href="http://mesh4x.org/" >mesh4x</a>. One of them is a Hibernate adapter, which allows you to plug into the mesh almost any relational database available in the market</p>  <h3>Hibernate Adapter</h3>  <p>In our first scenario, let's say you have, or you are quickly hacking together, an application to help enter, analyze and report information. You have a database schema, and you'd like to integrate it with an excel database that field folks are using for data entry. You need to make sure updates and deletes somehow make it out to the spreadsheets, and that folks' updates make it back in. Furthermore, you'd like folks in the field to synchronize spreadsheets with each other directly - thus making it a classic mesh scenario. With the Hibernate adapter, our goal is to allow you to mesh-enable your database by just mapping your entity fields to your database fields. </p>  <p><a href="http://www.hibernate.org/" >Hibernate</a>, as most developers know, is an Object-Relational Mapper library for Java. With this adapter you can now integrate into a data mesh any database engine that Hibernate supports, which is an impressive list. By supporting Hibernate as an adapter we allow every user to customize the mapping of the mesh data to their database schema using familiar tools, and get support for a lot of databases. There is still some work to do - for example, as of today the adapter still requires the database schema to revolve around the fact that the rows are being synchronized in a mesh. We expect in the upcoming weeks to remove this restriction and use two separate 'repositories', one for the synchronization information (which you shouldn't care about) and another one for your data. </p>  <p>This will allow you to point to almost any existing database schema and mesh it up without messing it up. (Apologies, couldn't resist).</p>  <p>You can always reach the project through <a href="http://mesh4x.org">http://mesh4x.org</a>.</p>  <p>Here you can see a <a href="http://code.google.com/p/mesh4x/issues/list?can=2&amp;q=component:Adapters&amp;colspec=ID%20Type%20Status%20Priority%20Milestone%20Owner%20Summary%20Mesh%20Component%20Stars" >list of adapters and suggest your own</a>.</p>  <div class="feedflare">

This can even happen between phones directly - you enter the phone number of another handset running the app and press "sync".

How can the person at A work better with the person at B beyond just sending data? How do we shift from 'sending' data to sharing realtime and enriched information two ways?

Episurveyor, Gather, Pendragon etc come to mind.</p>  <p>Within this directive, our roadmap on mesh4x will involve effort in four areas:</p>  <ul>   <li>Cloud Services</li>    <li>Data Standards</li>    <li>Client Applications</li>    <li>Transformers and Adapters</li> </ul>  <p>1. <strong>Cloud Services:</strong> A scalable server implementation supporting security standards . We have a skeletal solution built in C# that we grew from the 'sse' open source project in <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/sse">Codeplex</a>, (which has moved to <a href="http://mesh4x.org/">http://mesh4x.org</a> as well). We host an instance at <a title="http://sync.instedd.org/" href="http://sync.instedd.org/">http://sync.instedd.org/</a>. But it uses a relational database, so we <a href="http://lh3.ggpht.com/edujez/SO-xIMDvs8I/AAAAAAAAAMU/P6YBFyc1Umk/s1600-h/image%5B24%5D.png"><img style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="60" alt="Amazons web services include VM Hosting (EC2) Storage (S3) and Message Queuing (SQS)" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/edujez/SO-xIdcuHqI/AAAAAAAAAMY/XTZqoDLSfiw/image_thumb%5B16%5D.png?imgmax=800" width="144" align="left" border="0" /></a>would have to change the storage layer if we wanted to grow it¬†¬†¬† for real. So what are our options? Java on EC2/S3¬† seems to be the shortest path given the code <a href="http://lh5.ggpht.com/edujez/SO-xIzsGtGI/AAAAAAAAAMc/uirqioNgsc8/s1600-h/image%5B4%5D.png"><img style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="79" alt="Google App Engine - coolest logo in town!" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/edujez/SO-xJL_iQMI/AAAAAAAAAMg/u17pl35zAFE/image_thumb%5B2%5D.png?imgmax=800" width="100" align="right" border="0" /></a>we already have in the project, but Python on <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/">Google App Engine</a> sounds enticingly simple to¬† maintain and scale, at the expense of initial effort to port the sync libraries to Python. Which seems a unnecessary until you consider that Inveneo, the African Access Point and other platforms prefer Python or Ruby for a bunch of good reasons. We'd like your input - .NET+MySQL, Java, or Python + GAE?</p>  <p>2. <strong>Default</strong> <strong>Data Exchange Standards</strong>: Using <a href="http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/Forms/">XForms</a> is simple and works for easy scenarios.¬† <a href="http://lh5.ggpht.com/edujez/SO-xJqlXG2I/AAAAAAAAAMk/NUaULlXUxss/s1600-h/image%5B30%5D.png"><img style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="83" alt="this fun little thing looks like an RDF triplet, of sorts." src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/edujez/SO-xKGgoYPI/AAAAAAAAAMo/wW0V5WO5wE4/image_thumb%5B20%5D.png?imgmax=800" width="76" align="left" border="0" /></a>We'll advocate use of <a href="http://inao.blogspot.com/2007/01/so-what-hell-is-rdf-all-about.html">RDF</a> when XForms will fall short, but by all means we wanted to avoid a custom/ad hoc way of defining a typed dictionary 'schema', versioning of that schema, and of encoding entities following the schema. </p>  <p>Following a clear set of standards for data formats will allow easier mapping of information from one system to another, and the creation of tools that allow end-users to define how their systems integrate.</p>  <p>Isn't this obvious? Defining which standards to support early in the process is critical because it is easy to reinvent the wheel in this space. Even accidentally. Anyone who can code their way out of a paper bag can define a custom way of serializing dictionaries (a collection of names and values such as name:Ed, country:Cambodia) and define a schema model for it in an hour or so. But inventing one just tends to lead to incompatibilities in the long run, and lack of interoperability in humanitarian systems is an obstacle that anyone with experience has seen get in the way of collaboration and data sharing. It is much smarter to support a well documented subset of a standard such as RDF or XForms -and define extensions as needed (both standards allow schemas/ontologies to be extended). If we can we pledge to play along, applications from multiple organizations will add up to be 'more than the sum of the parts'</p>  <p>3. <strong>Client Applications:</strong> We desperately would like to implement or contribute to a stand-alone fat (aka rich) client that you can use on your desktop to synchronize two data endpoints. Ideally this client would allow you to set the endpoints for synchronization, mapping of data schemas, filters, and managing conflicts - in a secure and easy-to-use interface. Any pointers?</p>  <p>4.<strong> Transformers and Adapters</strong>: There are many existing applications out there that do their work very well. Sometimes two applications serve similar purposes for different audiences or contexts. Sometimes new applications have to coexist with politically entrenched older systems. While we are building common-purpose adapters to mesh4x (such as Hibernate, Java RMS, and KML which we already have but also CSV and google spreadsheets for example), we already hear demand for specific adapters that take into account particular needs of real-world applications that are already deployed in the field. Which systems should we start with? We have been approached with questions about mesh4x and <a href="http://openmrs.org/">OpenMRS</a> (<a title="http://openmrs.org/" href="http://openmrs.org/">http://openmrs.org/</a>) or <a href="http://www.sahana.lk/">Sahana</a> (<a title="http://www.sahana.lk/" href="http://www.sahana.lk/">http://www.sahana.lk/</a>).¬†</p><p>We'd love your input!</p><div class="feedflare">

Cell phone coverage can be present, ranging from reliable to dodgy for voice (just 1 bar of signal is typically reliable enough for SMS, but terrible for voice or data). </p>  <p><a href="http://lh6.ggpht.com/edujez/SGBGbaA0xmI/AAAAAAAAAKY/VzN_-AV2xJw/s1600-h/image%5B3%5D.png"><img style="border-top-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px" height="333" alt="A rural clinic in Rwanda, photo credit Neal Lesh of the OpenMRS community" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/edujez/SGBGcG8cPTI/AAAAAAAAAKc/55tZeSsxrSk/image_thumb%5B1%5D.png?imgmax=800" width="433" border="0" /></a></p>  <p>There are two sync scenarios I heard about this week talking with the OpenMRS and OpenROSA teams that Mesh4x addresses. (Note - we haven't planned to do this work yet I'm just using these scenarios as concrete examples of how mesh4x over SMS can help in the context of medical record management)</p>  <p><strong>Scenario 1: OpenMRS to OpenMRS sync</strong></p>  <p>The clinic is updating patient records that need to be kept up to date with the province-level hospital. In this case the clinic has a computer under a desk with a cell phone reliably plugged into it, and periodically, it would sync with a similar setup in the province level. It could also go straight up to central and then down again to the province level, as province hospitals do tend to have connectivity.   <br />    <br /><a href="http://lh4.ggpht.com/edujez/SGBGcvnduwI/AAAAAAAAAKg/Y6aMCp5npJU/s1600-h/IMG_1027%5B3%5D.jpg"><img style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="184" alt="Mr. Vanra Ieng shows a nift enclosure that makes sure the phone plugged in to the computer will be reliably working!" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/edujez/SGBGdGxcZJI/AAAAAAAAAKk/SDKmIPtQILs/IMG_1027_thumb%5B1%5D.jpg?imgmax=800" width="244" align="right" border="0" /></a>Here you can see Vanra Ieng from the WHO/Ministry of Health in Cambodia showing a physical enclosure that makes sure his phones - used in a similar setup, as an attachment to a computer- don't get unplugged from the PC or power, and are used for 'intended purposes' only (people have personal phones and other means of communication as well, and he needs to make sure it keeps running as this is for a pilot on sending disease indicators from key districts to central level).</p>  <p><strong>Scenario 2: OpenMRS to mobile data gathering client</strong> </p>  <p><a href="http://code.dimagi.com/JavaRosa/" >javaROSA</a> is an open source mobile client built in Java that is used for XForms-based data collection that works on lowest-common-denominator phones as well as PDAs. You can fill in the forms and send the data via Infrared, bluetooth, http (If there is GPRS available) </p>  <p>If I understood the conversations at the HISA meetings,they are working on a feature to send data one-way via SMS messages (serializing objects and sending them over a set of messages). With the SMS adapter, community health workers could be taking data on their mobile devices and updating centralized computers, as well as getting the latest information on the device nd updating their local information by querying for the information of patients they hadn't seen before but are facing now, or patients that have visited the clinic since the information was taken. In addition, they could even beam (SMS) information with a colleague directly, phone to phone.</p>  <p>In each scenario, though, how many text messages are we talking about? In our tests, starting with a large up-to-date dataset (a KML map) and added a &quot;pushpin&quot; with a relatively long description. It required a grand total of 8 text messages. This includes all the steps needed to compare versions on both sides of the communication, and send the new pushpin over (see Under the Hood for more details). </p>  <p>If there are more items that have changed, and the larger the items themselves, the more messages are required to transmit them, of course. But we think this is a very low baseline considering the outcome: up-do date information on both sides that can, in turn, be shared with more devices locally using even more economical means such as infrared or bluetooth.</p>  <h3>Under the hood</h3>  <p>So what does it take to synchronize data over text messages?&#160; </p>  <p>1) We need to be able to send/receive SMS messages from a phone via a USB cable. In the code we abstract this behind a provider model, and the default implementation will be based on SMSLib. We envision in a future a server version, potentially using BT's <a href="http://web21c.bt.com/" >web21c</a> infrastructure to do so.</p>  <p>2) The mesh protocol must be reduced to a bare minimum so it is efficient to use over tiny and unreliable text messages. We do so by combining exchanges that achieve the following:</p>  <ol>   <li>A collection-level check: is any sync needed? </li>    <li>Item-level checks: which items have been added, updated, or deleted relative to the version information available locally? </li>    <li>Item exchange - 2-way sending and receiving the changed items themselves. Originally we were zipping the data and sending that over if appropriate, now we are using a variation of the RSync algorithms which use creative hashing (math operations on the data) to send the minimal information over.</li> </ol>  <p>3) SMS is an unreliable transport and as such there is a layer in the code that compensates for this by managing message batches. A batch allows us to split up a large payload into text messages to reconstitute on the other side, tolerating messages coming out of order, dealing with lost messages, and timing out on operations that have taken too long to complete.</p>  <p>It is important to understand that the goal of this adapter is not only &quot;sending&quot; the data for a new item or &quot;receiving&quot; it - This adapter checks for which items to send/receive and also sends/receives the full versioning information for the item. That makes it possible to keep sharing it with other applications and users while maintaining the ability to reconcile updates and detect version conflicts.</p>  <p>A big kudos to Tondat who has been moving at warp speed with this codebase. The first checkin was on June 9th! The quality of the code is very high, and the ingenious use of gzip, Base91 and Rsync shows . <a href="http://code.google.com/p/mesh4x/wiki/Source" >Check out the source</a>.</p>  <h3>Next steps</h3>  <ul>   <li>Finish the optimization of the FeedSync protocol (which Mesh4x uses under the covers) in edge conditions (e.g. sharing conflicting payloads).</li>    <li>Implement the SMSLib adapter and test it well with a couple of appropriate phones.</li>    <li>Add this capability into the demo Java application that is used to demonstrate the KML adapter. This will let you specify a phone number in addition to the http URL and the file path in the sync endpoint box.</li>    <li>Further optimize formats, encoding and memory usage.</li>    <li>Pursue collaborations with openROSA/openMRS that resonate strongly with the <a href="http://maryjanemarcus.instedd.org/2008/05/empowerment-practice-explored.html" >community needs</a> we are see in South East Asia.

Our contributions will be based on the requirements observed in global health, community development and humanitarian aid.</p>  <p>You can find the project here: <a title="http://code.google.com/p/mesh4x/" href="http://code.google.com/p/mesh4x/">http://code.google.com/p/mesh4x/</a></p>  <p>Our first contribution to the project consists of some libraries that implement the FeedSync specification, an open standard that describes version vectors, and processes for conflict detection and conflict preservation. FeedSync also happens to be one of the underpinnings of Microsoft's consumer-targeted <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/livemesh/" >Live Mesh</a>, but could be used happily on any platform as it's based on extensions to RSS and ATOM - an obvious idea is to build a Feedsync javascript adapter for Google Gears). </p>  <p>Because of the project's emphasis on standards, we structured the source tree so it would host implementations in more than one platform and language. 'Mesh4x' has 2 starter source code folders - Mesh4j (Java), Mesh4n (.NET - a large C# contribution done by Clarius Labs and the Microsoft XML MVPs who already had an open source version, unit tests and all). We hope to eventually see Mesh4php, Mesh4r (Ruby) and so on.</p>  <p>It's a start. InSTEDD's work in SE Asia in addition to the input of humanitarian aid agencies and other providers of technology for social good will be the drivers behind our contributions. We expect work in these areas:</p>  <ul>   <li>Adapters to different stores (e.g. MySQL, or application-specific formats, such as KML), for servers &amp; clients, and the ETL (extract, transform, load) that goes at heterogeneous endpoints. I heard a great idea today for building open-source VMs that run on Amazon's cloud hosting.</li>    <li>Implementations that work on mobile devices (for example, we are currently refactoring the Java library to run in J2ME)</li>    <li>Support for different transports (plain XML over files, or HTTP is a start, but there are optimizations that can be done for low bandwidth, no-Internet scenarios, or integrating with a transport mesh like WASTE).</li>    <li>Integrating implementations with standards-based authentication and data signing approaches.</li>    <li>..your contributions!</li> </ul>  <h3>Applicability for Humanitarian &amp; Health Scenarios</h3>  <p>So why are we at InSTEDD interested in this? Data meshes have some interesting properties:</p>  <ul>   <li>Symmetrical: They allow data to exist in a concurrent multi-master environment where updates can be applied at any node in the mesh.</li>    <li>Asynchronous: They allow offline updates to information and synchronization with other nodes without requiring data locks, essential for occasionally connected applications.</li>    <li>Dynamic: The synchronization can happen even in constantly changing connectivity topologies. I can sync to a server and later the sync can be done between my client and another client, who could then sync with another server if the first one is there, and so on.</li> </ul>  <p>These properties make them very suitable for humanitarian, crisis, and health care environments, where information sharing, data system integration, and technologies that assist politically neutral solutions are beneficial. For example:</p>  <ul>   <li>Symmetry allows you to have two audiences work on the same data through different applications, with no application being the 'master'.&#160; You can also have data sharing of sensitive information between countries or organizations with no country hosting more or less data than the other. See <a href="http://maryjanemarcus.instedd.org/" >Mary Jane</a>'s post about the <a href="http://maryjanemarcus.instedd.org/2008/02/how-can-you-make-difference-in-country.html" >NGOs in Cambodia</a>, to understand how important this symmetry and neutrality can be. It also allows data to move around a user independently of the device it's been created on.</li>    <li>Asynchronicity allows work to happen in environments where data connections are unavailable, bandwidth is low, or the only 'transport' is a USB stick.</li>    <li>Dynamism allows the field teams to share data amongst themselves and servers as early as possible. Unlike email, there is no need to wait for connectivity to a specific server to let the information free.</li> </ul>  <p>One idea could be to add data mesh capabilities to Sahana, allowing any instance running on a server or laptop to edit the information and 'sync' both ways with any other server or laptop. We have also heard scenarios where users of FrontlineSMS could synchronize information amongst themselves. If anyone is interested we'd happily work with you to see how to approach this..</p>  <p>Come and participate - lets share our scenarios, ideas, and code here: <a title="http://code.google.com/p/mesh4x/" href="http://code.google.com/p/mesh4x/">http://code.google.com/p/mesh4x/</a></p>  <div class="feedflare">

MoPoTsyo, a local NGO that focuses on diabetes, will use InSTEDD iLab SEA‚Äôs Verboice platform to provide patients tips and advices through interactive voice calls.</p>
<p>Verboice is an interactive voice response (IVR) technology that lets you create and run applications via voice, thereby overcoming literacy and geographical barriers.</p>
<p><img class="alignright" title="Verboice" src="http://instedd.org/wp-content/uploads/verboice+Spider+iLabSEA-300x124.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="124" /></p>
<p>Within the next twelve months from this month, a selected 250 diabetes patients will receive pre-recorded voice messages of reminders to appointments, take medication, make healthy food choices, and exercise regularly.</p>
<p>Heang Hen, a Monitoring Officer at MoPoTsyo Patient Information Center, says that with this Verboice, it‚Äôs ‚Äúuseful and faster to send educational voice messages and information to patients.‚Äù</p>
<p>Prior to using Verboice, MoPoTsyo started this mobile phone diabetes self-management support by sending text messages to its randomly-selected 500 patients. However, patient recipients encountered a number of challenges, including navigating to the SMS inbox, limited Khmer-language support on mobile phone, and language barrier.</p>

But, when done right, the long-term impact can be transformational.</span></p></strong></span></div><p><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Grande'; font-size: 14px;">We are lucky to be involved with <a href="http://www.jembi.org/">Jembi</a>, <a href="http://www.regenstrief.org/">Regenstrief Institute</a> and others on implementing such a project in Rwanda, under the leadership of Dr. Richard Gakuba, who works for the Ministry of Health as the National eHealth Coordinator. <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/rgakuba">Dr. Gakuba</a> is leading the charge transforming Rwanda's <a href="http://www.who.int/healthinfo/systems/en/">Health Information System</a>.¬†<strong id="internal-source-marker_0.32446987787261605" style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="color: #000000; background-color: #ffffff; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">A big part of this modernization is the implementation of shared health records, terminology services, and facility and provider registries. When this phase of the project is done, Rwanda will have a variety of independent, but interoperating, web services that implement these capabilities. It may sound like a 2002 buzzword to call it a ‚Äúfabric‚Äù, but it evokes the right image: a supporting net of independent but inter-woven services.</span></strong></span></p><p><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Grande'; font-size: 14px;">Having a fabric of services makes a lot of sense in this context, starting with the impact of this architecture pattern on human and organizational dynamics. Distributing the ownership, management and maintenance of different areas of data is appropriate when the organization itself is made of different departments with different workflows, incentives, and management styles. Centralizing all these processes and information into a monolithic block would cause a collapse as the only entity able to change things would rapidly become a bottleneck. Just the provisioning and maintenance of one big system can be an insurmountable obstacle. Modularity allows piecemeal evolution.</span></p><h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Benefits</span></h2><p><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Grande'; font-size: 14px;">Having a "fabric" of services has many advantages:</span></p><p><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Grande'; font-size: 14px;"><strong>Creating an Ecosystem</strong> - services and their data can get used by others to create new "value-add services". ¬†For example, a facility registry could be extended with a call-in system to let immigrants get directions to nearby clinic in their own dialects. Enabling these value-add services (including mashups and client apps) allows the ecosystem of users (the general population, the local NGOs, the international ICT community, national and international private sector) to act like a gap-finder for better health services and businesses.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Grande'; font-size: 14px;"><strong>Potential for Big Data</strong> - Services provide a quantum leap over the traditional approach of keeping excel spreadsheets, access databases, and ad-hoc CSVs for research and retrospective data analysis. Data can be stored and versioned appropriately therefore simplifying future retrospective analysis. Taking advantage of these datasets comes with many challenges, however.¬†<strong id="internal-source-marker_0.32446987787261605" style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">For example, most countries do not have or enforce a framework where people opt-in to having their data stored, shared, and/or analyzed for research or commercial purposes. Rwanda has taken what I consider to be a great stance: </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-weight: normal; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">All data that will be kept centrally about individuals has to be approved 'column by column' </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">(using a relational metaphor). ¬†The data can be used only with scientific journal backed evidence that the information can be used to improve health outcomes within an actual project/program to do so</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">. </span></strong>Notice this may turn some big data fans pale ("What, you are not saving <em>everything</em> centrally and then figuring out what to do with it?"), but I think it is a smarter place to start.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Grande'; font-size: 14px;"><strong>Steps to Open Government </strong>-¬†While modest, the decision to have public data available as web services on the internet can be a milestone towards "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_government">open gov</a>". Opening up government data increases accountability, trust, and feedback loops. Many governments would probably prefer to pay lip service to open data principles rather than embrace them; but there are so many benefits to doing so in the health sector that it may be a great place to start.</span></p><h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Example Services</span></h2><p><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Grande'; font-size: 14px;">What are the services that could exist in such a fabric? The theoretical list runs long but here are some examples of the services we are dealing with in the real world:</span></p><ul><li><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Grande'; font-size: 14px;"><strong>Facility Registry</strong>: A service to keep track of facilities, their admin information, the health services they provide, and data about their catchment population.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Grande'; font-size: 14px;"><strong>Vital Registration</strong>: Service to keep track of births, deaths and Health ID management for the population (Note that a different ID assignment authority is needed: the United State's practice of using a unified social security number for financial ID, health ID and immigration purposes is considered 'bad practice' by modern standards, and I am happy where we are working with people who are staying away from unified IDs).</span></li><li><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Grande'; font-size: 14px;"><strong>Shared Health Record</strong>: Services that keep track of individual people's health data over time.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Grande'; font-size: 14px;"><strong>Provider Registry</strong>: A service that tracks the institutions and individuals who are licensed to work in the health system.

<h4><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>THE PROJECT:</strong></span></h4>
<h4>In April 2011, we began working with the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (NYC DOHMH) on a project called ECHO: Electronic Communication for Health Operations. The project was focused on helping the NYC DOHMH improve the ability of their Community Outreach Teams (COT) to gather emergency preparedness and response-related data in the field.</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These Community Outreach Teams teams deploy into local communities in order to share information as well as capture location-based data from those communities. The goal of the ECHO project was to support the COT teams by allowing them to create and fill out electronic surveys on a handheld devices and then transmit that information back to the Emergency Operations Center for analysis ‚Äî in near real-time.</p>
<p>Now, in situations that require an investigation (such as a potential disease outbreak) these teams will be able to create survey based forms and push them out to a team of people who each has their own Motorola Xoom tablet. The team will then collect answers to the survey by interviewing affected communities, and push them back to the server where they will later be able to export it to a Geographical Information System (GIS) tool.</p>";s:10:"post_title";s:65:"New Video - ECHO: Electronic Communications for Health Operations";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:185:"Have a look at our new video highlighting the ECHO: Electronic Communications for Health Operations project that we did with the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (NYC DOHMH).";s:11:"post_status";s:7:"publish";s:14:"comment_status";s:4:"open";s:11:"ping_status";s:4:"open";s:13:"post_password";s:0:"";s:9:"post_name";s:9:"echovideo";s:7:"to_ping";s:0:"";s:6:"pinged";s:0:"";s:13:"post_modified";s:19:"2011-09-20 21:02:06";s:17:"post_modified_gmt";s:19:"2011-09-21 04:02:06";s:21:"post_content_filtered";s:0:"";s:11:"post_parent";s:1:"0";s:4:"guid";s:26:"http://instedd.org/?p=3760";s:10:"menu_order";s:1:"0";s:9:"post_type";s:4:"post";s:14:"post_mime_type";s:0:"";s:13:"comment_count";s:1:"2";}i:72;O:8:"stdClass":23:{s:2:"ID";s:4:"5214";s:11:"post_author";s:1:"5";s:9:"post_date";s:19:"2008-03-30 16:34:42";s:13:"post_date_gmt";s:19:"2008-03-30 09:34:42";s:12:"post_content";s:2011:"<p>I'm taking off to Southeast Asia in a couple of hours.

I really like that approach to visualizing possibility, and wished it was used more as a social activity. <a href="http://www.strongangel3.net/" >Strong Angel</a> and <a href="http://www.superstructgame.org/" >Superstruct</a> do this too, in a way.

Reading through the original post and then through the comments (with a lot of&#160; ‚Äòstrong players‚Äô from the mobile applications community), a couple of thoughts emerged about the state of mobile technology applications for health and other social purposes. Here are some.</p>  <h3>In the future‚Ä¶where are the business models?</h3>  <p><a href="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_U5QZ4rdJlA4/SU9uHXJBsqI/AAAAAAAAARc/tjgWY52Y6ZI/s1600-h/image%5B21%5D.png"><img title="today (pic credits Eduardo Jezierski, InSTEDD)" style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; display: inline; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="162" alt="today (pic credits Eduardo Jezierski, InSTEDD)" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_U5QZ4rdJlA4/SU9uKKZtmUI/AAAAAAAAARg/BCGYFKaMHfg/image_thumb%5B11%5D.png?imgmax=800" width="244" border="0" /></a></p>  <p>If you are curious, here is the reality today: In June the week before the elections I visited Zimbabwe. Here you can see a real, resilient, working <a href="http://guavatechnologies.com/cm/Life%20Science%20Research/Platforms/Home.html" >Guava</a> machine for CD4 counts on the outskirts of Harare. It uses microfluidic technology (for smaller blood samples and reactant costs) and if I recall correctly the operating principle is the same as the phone above which is a tested technology. The thing is solid, and the staff deemed it highly reliable. Calibration was not an issue. They were able to multiply the amount of CD4 lab counts manifold to 300+ per day. I was there discussing the possibility to link to the lab record system, but it wasn‚Äôt the highest priority. </p>  <p>A lot of the discussion did center around how disruptive it would be to have an open platform (open hardware, open software, open assays, open IP on the test methods, open reactant formulas and manufacturing) for these tests. </p>  <p>Just as a $99 iPhone is a red herring for the phone network costs you are going to pay every year, a cheaper test sensor that becomes widely deployed and relies on proprietary reactants has a hidden, more insidious cost. </p>  <p>I did not check what are the assays or lab system used by the LUCAS phone in the Wired article, and whether they are open. I just was surprised this dimension wasn‚Äôt part of the interview. I encourage Ozcan from UCLA to open-source the hardware specification to allow others to build on it!</p>  <p>Question: When you plug something in do you say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm using electricity‚Äù or ‚ÄúI‚Äôm using the wall socket‚Äù? Sometimes I feel the discussion about innovation in mobile tech sounds like a discussion of innovation in energy‚Ä¶where the discussion centers on the design of plugs &amp; sockets. A phone is just a conduit to a network, and a powerful, sensor-rich, user-friendly device can be underused as a collaboration tool that help people work better together if network reliability and costs are not managed in unison.</p>  <p>In my 2011, I hope that there are hybrid social-enterprise efforts that can make inroads to working with wireless providers and carriers. They need to evolve their offerings and provide the types of cost structures needed for health and social good to scale and not depend on infusion of donations to keep running OR pushing costs where they can‚Äôt be paid while willing customers cant spend their money. Even just helping providers make money differently would help a lot. Examples: toll-free-SMS?&#160; Free-to-send? Free-to-receive? Mobile banking? Shared-costs billing? Provider-supplied location tracking of registered gov‚Äôt health staff? Anonimized tracking of random individuals for disease migration modeling? it goes on.. Providers could make more money (gasp!) and they don‚Äôt.</p>  <p>Beyond 2011 I hope more effort gets put into creating connectivity approaches that would be disruptive to current wireless systems. And I mean the ‚Äúsystem‚Äù of government spectrum licensing + carriers + wireless providers + device manufacturers. But who would fund this research? Sigh‚Ä¶we need smaller, personal, cheaper GSM ‚Äòtowers‚Äô that can be linked up more than phones. What would happen if every smartphone could host a 802.13 ‚Äòpeer‚Äô network?</p>  <h3>Centralized or Distributed mobile apps? There are no ‚Äòbest‚Äô practices‚Ä¶ </h3>  <p>There are only proven practices, in context. </p>  <p>When evaluating whether an approach fits a new situation, you have to consider the context in which other solutions succeeded or failed. I face this all the time in the discussion of ‚Äòcentralized‚Äô versus ‚Äòindividual‚Äô mobile solutions. Sometimes I get asked which approach is better and the answer is a) it depends b) you want both, not either/or.</p>  <p><a href="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_U5QZ4rdJlA4/SU9uNb5EGHI/AAAAAAAAARk/JF58FThrmUU/s1600-h/image%5B13%5D.png"><img title="Server side approaches work well with large scale requirements" style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; display: inline; margin-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="238" alt="Server side approaches work well with large scale requirements" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_U5QZ4rdJlA4/SU9uO9MhG-I/AAAAAAAAARo/QtYn37lp3wc/image_thumb%5B7%5D.png?imgmax=800" width="244" align="right" border="0" /></a> The centralized approach uses national or international-scale gateways, like <a href="http://ushahidi.com/" >Ushahidi</a> with Clickatell, <a href="http://mobileactive.org/wiki/RapidSMS_Review" >RapidSMS</a>, InSTEDD GeoChat with <a href="http://www.clickatell.com/" >Clickatell</a> and BT, and so on.

This type of ‚Äòindividual‚Äô solution can even run in a smartphone, and <a href="http://www.frontlinesms.com/" >FrontlineSMS</a> and other projects are already proposing such a migration. For GeoChat, we put it on the backlog until we saw more demand for this approach from our Asia programs. </p>  <p>Approaches like <a href="http://mobileactive.org/wiki/RapidSMS_Review" >RapidSMS</a> which rely on an Asterisk server can also work on a laptop, or on a server, and can help span a ‚Äòmiddle ground‚Äô between other solutions.</p>  <p>Scalability is important, but, I see <a href="http://frontlinesms.ning.com/forum/topic/show?id=2052630:Topic:7108" >discussions</a> of scalability center around numbers of messages and numbers of registered users which is for most cases profoundly irrelevant.

For GeoChat, for example, our main scalability metric is latency of roundtrip messages under sustained use (like twitter, responses have to come out fast) across all channels (SMS, email, twitter) under large number of group users and groups. </p>  <p>But why one approach or the other?</p>  <p>Some applications support both centralized and decentralized models (like GeoChat) but as we start working together in this budding mobile community it makes sense to pool efforts and re-use each others‚Äô technologies. I don‚Äôt see why InSTEDD for example should build yet-another-phone-detection-and-driver layer if other ‚Äúsocial good‚Äù applications have it. For example, FrontlineSMS can forward messages on to Ushahidi (acting as a local gateway). We will take a similar approach with InSTEDD and should be emulated by the rest of the community. By working on common protocols all our apps could forward messages to each other as required (see this <a href="http://mobilehacking.org/index.php/SMS_Post" >example as a working draft from the Open Mobile Consortium</a> Katrin mentioned) (And Ken, if you are reading this, contributing to <a href="http://www.frontlinesms.com/" >FrontlineSMS</a> source was on my last years‚Äô resolutions, and now that we got access to the source code we can really start work on integrating/implementing it with GeoChat, Mesh4x, etc‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm optimistic about ‚Äò09)!</p>  <p><a href="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_U5QZ4rdJlA4/SU9ue7TmVWI/AAAAAAAAAR8/6GpZGJJ0elo/s1600-h/image%5B38%5D.png"><img title="rough sketch of whewre it is all going (in terms of message exchange topology, at a very high level)" style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; display: inline; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="332" alt="rough sketch of whewre it is all going (in terms of message exchange topology, at a very high level)" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_U5QZ4rdJlA4/SU9uiJWMUgI/AAAAAAAAASE/1Ea5-OdW52k/image_thumb%5B25%5D.png?imgmax=800" width="463" border="0" /></a> </p>  <p>The goal is to be able to pick the right tool for the context, and all the applications mentioned above are already working on protocols that would let you have a hybrid deployment that would allow you to scale up or out as needed. As contexts change, having freedom to evolve your app and not be locked into one or another is key. </p>  <p>Once you are moving messages around, how do you make sure different applications interpret the information in similar ways?</p>  <h3>Shared formats for data exchange</h3>  <p>To achieve interoperability, and reuse the human capital of having trained users, mobile apps should also share conventions on what gets put IN the messages. There is a huge gap in defining what gets put on SMS messages for diverse uses:</p>  <ul>   <li>Free text, with specified language</li>    <li>Free text with explicit tags</li>    <li>Locations (lat/long, place names, village PCodes etc)</li>    <li>Delimited data (e.g. Ed, Jezierski, Cambodia)</li>    <li>Self Describing Data (e.g. firstn:Ed|lastn=Jez|city=Seattle</li>    <li>Multi-Message batching, sequenced or order-agnostic</li>    <li>Message batch retries</li>    <li>Compression</li>    <li>and the list goes on‚Ä¶</li> </ul>  <p>The community of builders of mobile apps for social purposes has to start catching up in this space. I suggest re-using the leadership of twitter and other services in evolving some conventions (eg @user, #tag) in common ways where applicable. I would also like e.g. Nokia‚Äôs data gathering solutions and other industry players e.g. Google to participate in the open forum, too.</p>  <p>For example, In the Cambodian Avian Influenza hotline pilot we implement batching and self-describing data over SMS. We should get together with RapidSMS, and define a common approach. This would let the Cambodian government switch out InSTEDDs backend and put RapidSMS transparently, if they chose to do so. </p>  <p>One example of this is GeoChat + <a href="http://www.openrosa.org/index.php/javarosa" >JavaROSA</a>. We want to support <a href="http://www.openrosa.org/index.php/javarosa" >JavaROSA</a> front ends to send structured data to GeoChat, and if we documented the format well, other clients (like Nokia‚Äôs?) or servers could be used interchangeably. </p>  <p><a href="http://www.openrosa.org/index.php/javarosa" >JavaROSA</a> is an excellent open source project, great technology and well run. We have contributed the ability to do 2-way sync between phones and between a phone and a server, already. </p>  <p>Even with these agreements interoperability can also lead to a shallow openness, where applications work with others‚Ä¶ as long as they can continue to hoard the data and lock-in users. You can see this happening over the last year in the space of social networking technologies, where many announcements of open approaches veil an underlying strategy of trying to become the ‚Äòhub‚Äô or the ‚Äòone stop shop‚Äô. </p>  <p>Do the benefited populations really gain much if folks can collect more data, but we they can‚Äôt move it around?</p>  <h3>Sharing Data</h3>  <p>We all know the limits to sharing data are political or incentive-based, more than technical. But technology makes a fine excuse for not sharing information.</p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p>In the field one faces many silos ‚Äì NGOs with different mandates, Government agencies with different domains (animal health, human health), research programs funded by different ivy league universities, not to mention ethnic, language and country borders. </p>  <p>This is an area where InSTEDD has been doing a lot of work as part of the <a href="http://mesh4x.org" >Mesh4x</a> project, which basically allows data to be shared two-ways between disparate systems.</p>  <p>Here are some latest updates</p>  <ul>   <li><a href="http://edjez.instedd.org/2008/12/for-geeks-progress-on-mesh4x-cloud.html" >For Geeks: Progress on Mesh4x: Cloud Services, Architecture, Adapters, and Adopters</a> ‚Äì here you can see how Frontline would play with Mesh4x.</li>    <li><a href="http://edjez.instedd.org/2008/10/mesh4x-goes-mobile-with-javarosa-allows.html" >Mesh4x goes mobile with JavaROSA, allows you to sync data on your handset with no Internet</a></li> </ul>  <p><a href="http://www.cdc.gov/about/leadership/leaders/lenert.htm">Leslie (Les) Lenert</a>, Director, National Center for Public Health Informatics, <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/">US CDC</a>, puts forward technologies they believe are disruptive.

I smile every time I see it.</p>  <p>We can‚Äôt forget that all these technology efforts are trying to empower individuals and organizations, and simplify the work of caring for one‚Äôs own community or for others.</p>  <p>All the teams mentioned here are working together already in different capacities towards this end goal. Resources, timelines, tools are always an issue, but over time things will be more integrated.</p>  <p>All the technologies mentioned here are converging towards a shared architecture ‚Äìa platform for data exchange and collaboration built around mobile users in the harshest environments. A platform that can start small and grow transparently, or start large and continue running even if the centralized networks are unavailable. Because of this shared architecture, the end portfolio will be stronger, dollars spent on technology will go further, and users will have a simpler entry point to learn what are the right tools for their context.</p>  <p>So when a new phone comes out with a CD4 blood cell sensor, its users will know that it can send its data and ‚Äúit just works‚Äù...and then go change the world one CD4 test at a time!</p>  <div class="feedflare">

As many of our readers know, InSTEDD, with a collection of competent, attentive, and collegial partners around the world, had a team on the ground at the Port au Prince airfield within about 72 hours after the quake. We accomplished some significant and continuing good and I'll discuss that elsewhere. February, though, began in Bangkok.</p>
<h2>Prince Mahidol of Songla</h2>
<p>Each year the Prince Mahidol Award Conference selects one or more global leaders in public health for recognition of their lifetime achievements. The ceremony, in Thailand, serves as a useful opportunity to hold one of the better Public Health conferences of the year. More than 1,000 attendees from dozens of countries converge on Bangkok for three days of presentations and conversations, and this year InSTEDD had a very strong presence.</p>
<h2>Press Conference</h2>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_bCfOFHv--fs/S30L7fGTATI/AAAAAAAAB4M/6_XN_G6HFJw/s1600-h/THPF.jpg"><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5439517041521525042" style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 343px; height: 51px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_bCfOFHv--fs/S30L7fGTATI/AAAAAAAAB4M/6_XN_G6HFJw/s320/THPF.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><br /> The week began with a separate Press Conference led by the Thai Health   Promotions Foundation. They were describing our new SMS shortcode for   GeoChat-based reporting and alerting everywhere in Thailand, and   included recognition of our implementing partners in Thailand (Change   Fusion and OpenDream), our most prominent funder in the Mekong   (Google.org) and our new relationship with a Thai communications company   (DTAC).</p>
<p>We've spent a lively and interesting few months shaping a business relationship with DTAC around SMS messaging in <a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_bCfOFHv--fs/S30MPR5IMKI/AAAAAAAAB4U/h_eqycTdLZw/s1600-h/Change+Fusion+logo.jpg"><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5439517381574013090" style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 200px; height: 45px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_bCfOFHv--fs/S30MPR5IMKI/AAAAAAAAB4U/h_eqycTdLZw/s320/Change+Fusion+logo.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a>humanitarian support. In January we all found some common ground and implemented a good first step at lowering the financial thresholds for disease reporting and outbreak surveillance. Our goal is<a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_bCfOFHv--fs/S30MesD853I/AAAAAAAAB4c/-0e0pkhLpOc/s1600-h/OpenDream+logo.jpg"><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5439517646296770418" style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 227px; height: 46px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_bCfOFHv--fs/S30MesD853I/AAAAAAAAB4c/-0e0pkhLpOc/s320/OpenDream+logo.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a> to provide a free SMS shortcode for GeoChat use everywhere in Thailand and we're getting there. We're now confident thatwe can continue to refine our new relationship into a model for other areas of the developing world that need a reporting and alerting capability for emergencies.</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_bCfOFHv--fs/S30MvpBud1I/AAAAAAAAB4k/-1j0YDfZ4ps/s1600-h/DTAC+logo.jpg"><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5439517937539905362" style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 107px; height: 70px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_bCfOFHv--fs/S30MvpBud1I/AAAAAAAAB4k/-1j0YDfZ4ps/s320/DTAC+logo.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a>Based on the later media coverage it was apparently a very successful press conference, conducted mostly in Thai, with DTAC explaining what they've done with our partnerships, and Change Fusion demonstrating a few of the new capabilities in GeoChat. I've just heard this week that InSTEDD and our partners made it to the front page of the newspapers in Bangkok, and I'd already seen video from television broadcasts of the event. Although it's all in Thai, I'll share them here at <a href="http://www.ch7.co.th/news/news_thailand_detail.aspx?c=2&amp;p=6&amp;d=67865">Thai TV Video 1</a> and <a href="http://www.thaipbs.or.th/s1000_obj/front_page/page/1058.html?content_id=237206&amp;content_detail_id=641675&amp;content_category_id=683,684,685,686,687,688,689"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Thai TV Video 2</span></a>.</p>
<h2>Channe Suy</h2>
<p>A day or so later Channe Suy, InSTEDD's Product Manager from our Innovation Lab in Phnom Penh, presented to a large Prince Mahidol audience our ideas around InSTEDD's Innovation Lab concept, and specifically why we have one in Cambodia. She touched on the value of the open and shared space for innovative technical work that we've provided since 2008, and she spent some time describing our focus on capacity building, local teams working in local languages, interoperability, integration with existing workflow and tools, and how InSTEDD works toward an intersection of grassroots needs and national priorities. Channe gave a terrific talk, well delivered and well received, and I heard great comments about it throughout the rest of the conference.</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_bCfOFHv--fs/S30Sjmo2HPI/AAAAAAAAB48/zjtVNjTm1sk/s1600-h/Whiteboard-iLab.jpg"><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5439524327810014450" class="alignleft" style="cursor: pointer; width: 222px; height: 150px; border: 0pt none;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_bCfOFHv--fs/S30Sjmo2HPI/AAAAAAAAB48/zjtVNjTm1sk/s200/Whiteboard-iLab.jpg" border="0" alt="" width="200" height="136" /></a></p>
<h2>Magic Wheel</h2>
<p>One topic Channe addressed was our <em>Magic Wheel</em> -- a physical object -- that helps minimally-literate Community Health Workers report disease outbreaks in a consistent, reproducible, error-correcting fashion using a tool we've designed that looks a little like a circular slide rule. It received rave reviews for its simplicity, clever, intuitive, and robust mathematical structure, and its adaptability across languages. We'll talk more about it when the field testing is a little further along.<a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_bCfOFHv--fs/S30RwFloA2I/AAAAAAAAB40/wPlpF4Cb760/s1600-h/Magic+Wheel.jpg"><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5439523442764809058" style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 200px; height: 150px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_bCfOFHv--fs/S30RwFloA2I/AAAAAAAAB40/wPlpF4Cb760/s200/Magic+Wheel.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a></p>
<h2>Policy and Tech</h2>
<p>I, too, spoke at the conference. My topic was policy and technology in Health Information Systems and I spoke about the need for better guidelines around cloud computing, the challenges between transparency (public safety) and privacy (personal safety) in an emergency, a little about interoperability (as always...), code-escrows, telco contracts, capacity building, and deliberate exit strategies that leave new capabilities properly in the hands of responsible agencies. I was drawing on our work in Haiti and elsewhere (with photographs for illustration), and it was probably a bit much for a 20-minute talk, but you can judge for yourself <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/rasmussene/rasmussen-prince-mahidol-28-jan-10">here</a>.</p>
<p>A few days later in Phnom Penh, we were all able to reconnect in the iLab, getting together as the largest single gathering of the InSTEDD team in a year, and sharing in a gorgeous and moving Buddhist Blessing Ceremony for our place and our work. It was a nice moment in the history of the lab and I think it bodes very well for the coming year.</p>

<h2>The Innovation Lab</h2>
<p>We had several days in Cambodia, and it was great to see the new faces as people join us, and to watch how well the iLab has moved forward to address concrete problems identified by local staff. It's a terrific model for developing a local brain trust within a neutral space, addressing local cross-sectoral problems, and it's getting better constantly as we learn.</p>
<p>We intend to adapt the iLab idea to new sites and new needs over the coming years, and we're watching now for locations where this capacity building might be most useful. Suggestions are welcome!

NASA, NOAA, and Sun attendees were active participants. Then someone showed up dressed as a teddy bear. One of the panel members was a little blue cat. When Xantha Oe (the little blue cat) spoke, we all listened, as it explained the approaches its team had taken to visualize stock market trends -using floating shapes of volumes and colors one could fly around.</p>  <p>Where was all this taking place? The conference was <a href="http://www.life20.net/" >Life 2.0</a> and the venue <a href="http://secondlife.com/" >Second Life</a>, one of the most popular virtual worlds engines and services available today. In Second Life, you get to create your virtual avatar, and given basic rules of physics and some construction tools, create buildings, clothes, vehicles..and environments where information can be visualized and played with in novel ways.</p>  <p><strong>How does a conference work in Second Life?</strong></p>  <p>This particular session was interesting to our work so I logged into the 'grid' on a side monitor, teleported my avatar into <a href="http://slurl.com/secondlife/CMP%204/15/241/25" >the conference area</a> (I had registered as a Life 2.0 attendee before) and sat at one of the chairs in the auditorium. I turned on the video and audio streams which allowed me to hear the presentation as spoken by the panel and see the passing slides on huge screens. There is a common chat session for everyone in the area (when you 'talk' others in the amphitheater can 'hear' you). The best is that all of this infrastructure can be put together for free - an interesting approach to hold a meeting for non-profits who have tech-savvy members.</p>  <p><a href="http://lh3.google.com/edujez/R-F2xoZLmYI/AAAAAAAAADs/HIZLVvgjYVQ/image4?imgmax=800"><img style="border-top-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px" height="320" alt="Life 2.0 Visualization talk. Can you see the little blue cat on the panel?" src="http://lh5.google.com/edujez/R-F2zIZLmZI/AAAAAAAAAD0/qKysakzjMIg/image_thumb2?imgmax=800" width="448" border="0" /></a> </p>  <p><strong>The Talk</strong></p>  <p>The talk was divided into five 10-minute presentations ranging from visualizing stock prices to mathematical models and statistical analysis applied to chemistry. My key takeaways:</p>  <ul>   <li>All visualizations basically work by consuming data in some external web service (it is possible to <a href="http://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/LSL_Portal" >script Second Life objects using LSL</a> to make <a href="http://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/Category%3ALSL_HTTP" >HTTP calls</a> and get/post information from arbitrary services). There was only one example of a visualization using in-world data held in &quot;notes&quot; - Second Life's version of a sticky note. Some visualizations consume data in proprietary stores designed to serve the required information of their particular domain (e.g. the chemistry data), but others are more general purpose and take data from RSS feeds. I found it innovative that one of the visualizations actually took a Google docs spreadsheet URL and got its data directly from there. Maybe a pattern to follow for other graphing/analysis toolkits? </li>    <li>Many of these visualizations are available as open source with real examples in-world of how they are used. There was at least one commercial venture building products in the area.<a href="http://lh3.google.com/edujez/R-F21oZLmaI/AAAAAAAAAD8/G_nOKuNpQdI/image20?imgmax=800"><img style="border-top-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px" height="257" alt="image" src="http://lh4.google.com/edujez/R-F224ZLmbI/AAAAAAAAAEE/6ItQigDbDG4/image_thumb12?imgmax=800" width="412" border="0" /></a> (as the example above from <a href="http://www.greenphosphor.com/" >Green Phosphor</a>) </li>    <li>The intrinsically collaborative environment of Second Life is a good place to visualize together. I was happy to see folks paying attention to building visualizations to support conversations between multiple people and using them to lower the bar of shared understanding (as opposed to making the super-specialized visualization only one expert will consume on his/her own). </li>    <li><a href="http://lh6.google.com/edujez/R-F26YZLmcI/AAAAAAAAAEM/gc5yDd8dAuA/image8?imgmax=800"><img style="border-top-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px" height="213" alt="Second Earth" src="http://lh6.google.com/edujez/R-F27YZLmdI/AAAAAAAAAEU/yIF5d_bDKvY/image_thumb4?imgmax=800" width="244" align="right" border="0" /></a>There is a growing amount of work in the area of visualization related to geography and real-world physical structures. Examples of building design and architecture were given, where layouts were optimized as a result of overlaying heatmap visualizations on virtual models of real areas (e.g. airports, highways) . One project of interest was &quot;<a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/Infotech/18911/" >Second Earth</a>&quot; an open database of shapes and imagery that can be used to create realistic globes and maps in second life and add data on top, such as <a href="http://secondliferesearch.blogspot.com/2007/07/second-life-google-earth-second-earth.html" >animated weather simulations</a>. They are even working on a KML importer so you could consume in-world the same visualizations. For rigor I'll mention there are <a href="http://envirolink.blogspot.com/2007/03/google-earth-in-second-life.html" >other</a> similar efforts. This could support scenarios beyond collaborative visualization to hybrid <a href="http://ict4peace.wordpress.com/2006/11/20/mobile-phones-augmenting-reality/" >'augmented reality' applications</a> where geo-tagging and field logistics blend in information from the virtual world onto images of the real world. </li> </ul>  <p>One thing I was sorry about is that due to a previous appointment I missed another whole session of Life 2.0 dedicated to nonprofits and humanitarian work sponsored by the MacArthur Foundation. If I can chase down one of the presenters and get a recording I'll post it here.</p>  <p>&#160;<a href="http://lh5.google.com/edujez/R-F2-IZLmeI/AAAAAAAAAEc/nBuRN6Cd1jI/image24?imgmax=800"><img style="border-top-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px" height="271" alt="The auditorium was packed.

And obviously the technologies are still maturing, adding some hurdles to the implementation. It's still hard but not frivolous.</p>  <p><a href="http://lh3.google.com/edujez/R-F3AoZLmgI/AAAAAAAAAEs/uAeDTwuWD-s/image31?imgmax=800"><img style="border-top-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px" height="163" alt="image" src="http://lh6.google.com/edujez/R-F3BYZLmhI/AAAAAAAAAE0/hVZkNEYV2do/image_thumb19?imgmax=800" width="182" align="right" border="0" /></a>On the other side, seeing this ongoing work and its outcomes means that the area will be constantly improving, and that there could be breakthroughs in how people visualize and understand information together. And if it's what it takes to get there, I'm willing to take the advice of a little blue cat.</p>  <div class="feedflare">

In that student can improve their skill and more ready with job market competition.<br /><br />On August 27th, the team gave a first talk to BBU student. There are about 60 students attending, almost all of them are in 3rd and 4th year and majority coming from IT field. No one among them got job yet, most of them are actually looking for job. <br /><br />The main topic talked in that day is "Version Control", the team chose that topic because they see that almost every work place nowadays using version control.

But it would have not -I believe- been used much, if at all. </p>  <p><a href="http://lh6.ggpht.com/edujez/SA0GeRjbYvI/AAAAAAAAAGE/v7qtqa-WKno/s1600-h/image%5B9%5D.png" ><img style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="154" alt="The geochat thingie" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/edujez/SA0GfhjbYwI/AAAAAAAAAGM/8O79FpuBa9c/image_thumb%5B7%5D.png?imgmax=800" width="116" align="right" border="0" /></a>Our bad on the omission (easy to add), but I think it would be good to explain why we did what we did, why we'd do it again (with the addition of the microformat support), and why I think a lot of usability testing is still required to make the the conversation about microformats from SMS phones more realistic.</p>  <p>Some background- microformats, like anything that increases interoperability and has the long-term potential of reducing user training, are pure goodness. Microformats specify ways to represent common pieces of information, such as the following for position:</p>  <p><em>l:lat,lon</em>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; </p>  <p>...where l is a small L for location, and lat, lon are latitude and longitude. You can also add a location name like so:</p>  <p><em>l:cityname=lat,long</em></p>  <p>However in our proof of concepts we accept the following formats, and had to do some extra tricks to work with the input of the non-tech-savvy users. Here are some examples:</p>  <table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2" width="400" border="0"><tbody>     <tr>       <td valign="top" width="157"><font size="1">lat*long*message</font></td>        <td valign="top" width="241"><font size="1">Basic - Lat and long in decimal format with a point, a comma or any (with poor eyesight, when stressed, or in sunlight, it is easy to mix a . with a ,)</font></td>     </tr>      <tr>       <td valign="top" width="157"><font size="1">32.121            <br />32. 121             <br />32, 121</font></td>        <td valign="top" width="241"><font size="1">Weird variations of numeric input for decimal lat/longs.

This gives the user a chance to correct.</font></td>     </tr>      <tr>       <td valign="top" width="157"><font size="1">Choice of separators</font></td>        <td valign="top" width="241"><font size="1">We chose * instead of , ; or # as it was more accessible on all phones we tested, without needing a trip to the symbols menu in most cases.</font></td>     </tr>      <tr>       <td valign="top" width="157"><font size="1">Geocoding cities and addresses           <br />Palo Alto, CA*Sunny!            <br />Phnom Penh*Kh'mim Pain-haa</font></td>        <td valign="top" width="241"><font size="1">In an urban setting, lat/longs are a nuisance unless you are in a flood or vectoring a helicopter.

It was a diverse audience - we had in the same room a range of cell phones (from baby Nokias to Blackberrys)&#160; and the people had a range of expertise (some use their phone for email and calendar, others never used SMS before). We assumed we just had one chance to train them so we explained it once, and asked them to start sending messages. The log we got was invaluable as raw input - and informed the parsing algorithms to make them more robust for the actual exercise. </p>  <p>A quickie 1st hand test you can try at home: I have a collection of diverse phones to try these things out on - even phones with Khmer Script input support!. So let me see...it takes approximate 70 keystrokes to enter L:123.45,67.89 in a small Nokia, with no errors.&#160; To enter 123.45*67.89 it took me approximately 50 keystrokes. The microformat takes ~40% more key presses (and this particular phone uses the * key for the symbol pad, so that even plays against my point).</p>  <p>I know folks in <a href="http://dharmafly.com/blog/bangladeshboat" >diverse</a> settings have tried the microformat and it <a href="http://twitter.com/bangladeshboat/statuses/376953702" >works</a> to communcate position (of course), but I'm not sure it was a representative audience of a broad set of non-tech-savvy users. The breakdown is not in the data itself, but the usability of the format.</p>  <h3>Lessons learnt and realizing it's an ongoing effort</h3>  <p>The key lesson for me is to make sure we accept the location microformat <em>in addition to </em>more user-friendly formats. If folks know the microformat beforehand (an exception rather than the norm) they can expect 'it just works'. </p>  <p>Alternative paths include applying machine learning feature-extraction efforts to the information, or building a smart client for rich phones that formats message for you (from the GPS?), so the user never sees the location&#160; 'wire' format at all. All approaches have pros and cons.</p>  <p>I am also wondering what activity is ongoing in the area of <a href="http://www.funkfeuer.net/2008/04/14/what-are-microformats-and-what-do-they-mean-to-mobile/" >nanoformats</a>, microformats which are slightly friendlier for numeric pad input. It's trivial to <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/twitternanoformats" >invent</a> tiny ways of representing bits of information. The problem is that unless done right they can shift power away from the end user towards the engineers who consume that data. I don't see that as a positive power shift.</p>  <p>To make the effort real these nanoformats would have to get usability testing and feedback from real users in real situations to grow them into something intuitive and easy to enter in different phones. </p>  <p>To do that we (the 'big we') have to continue to experiment with easy to remember schemes which can be trained in one shot, can be context-specific, can be easier to discover, recall and communicate, and works even for a health volunteer who cares a lot about the content and doesn't care about the format at all. </p>  <p>In the end, I believe the best formats, like the best technologies, will be invisible to the end users.</p>  <p>If you are a geo-geek hope to see you at <a href="http://en.oreilly.com/where2008/public/content/home" >Where 2.0</a> (InSTEDD is presenting there) in a couple of weeks so we can continue the dialogue!</p>  <div class="feedflare">

<p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/lAb-79JSz-o" frameborder="0" width="560" height="315"></iframe></p>
<p>¬†</p>
<p>Because their immune systems are so vulnerable, people living with HIV have a 20 times higher risk of dying from tuberculosis than anyone else. ¬†Thriving in the wake of the HIV pandemic, tuberculosis is a disease that has gone from near-extinction to being one of the world‚Äôs most common and deadly conditions.¬† ¬†According to WHO, TB is one of the top causes of death among women¬†and children in the world <a href="http://www.who.int/tb/publications/global_report/gtbr12_executivesummary.pdf">(WHO, 2011)</a>. ¬†An estimated 14 million people worldwide are infected with active TB.</p>
<p>But there is hope. Research now confirms that people can take a simple daily pill ‚Äî isoniazid preventative therapy (IPT) ‚Äî to protect themselves from TB during the months in which their immune systems are most vulnerable. ¬† The WHO now recommends that all people living with HIV who don‚Äôt have tuberculosis already should be given access to these life saving pills. ¬†But sadly, it is estimated that among 33 million people living with HIV worldwide, only 1.7 million (5%) have been tested for TB and only about 85,000 (0.2%) were offered TB preventive therapy.</p>
<p>That‚Äôs where the TB Tech project comes in. ¬†InSTEDD and its partners at <a href="http://kijaniconsulting.com/">Kijani</a>, <a href="http://www.popcouncil.org/">Population Council</a>, and <a href="http://www.ampathkenya.org/">AMPATH-Kenya</a> are working to design, develop, implement, and evaluate information and communication technologies to improve TB care among people living with HIV. ¬† As an initial phase of this project, our team is focused on a TB care reminder system.¬† This reminder system uses information from patient electronic medical records (<a href="http://openmrs.org/">OpenMRS</a>) to give medical providers the right reminders at the right time about what they can do during each patient visit to improve TB diagnosis and prevention among their patients.</p>
<p>This project takes place in 3 stages.</p>
<p><strong>1. Design</strong>: Using techniques from User-Centered Design, we are creating the best reminder system possible using iterative input from key stakeholders and providers in Kenyan clinics and¬†hospitals. ¬†Part of this involves engaging users early and often during the design process. ¬†This started with long conversations and meetings in January. ¬†And, between now and May, we will engage users in usability testing to make sure that our reminders are accurate, effective, and satisfying to busy clinicians working in very resource-constrained settings.</p>
<p><strong>2. Deploy</strong>: In June/July, we will launch our system across dozens of clinics across Western Kenya, from one-room buildings with¬†corrugated¬†tin roofs to three-story regional hospitals.</p>
<p><strong>3. ¬†Evaluate impact</strong>: Using a cluster-randomized clinical trial, we will measure the impact of the TB Tech reminder system to determine how many more people living with HIV are tested for TB and start preventative therapies. ¬†Ultimately, the more people who get this preventative medication, the more who will be saved from TB and from the illness and death that so often follows.</p>
<p>But, we are just getting started. ¬†Check out this travel log (above) from our first trip to Kenya, collecting stories, ideas, and information from the patients, providers, and local leaders.</p>
<p>Updates to come!</p>

I was ecstatic when the first translated line came in, and another one volunteers started explaining the task to other volunteers, and the speed picked up pretty fast.</p>  <p><a href="http://lh3.ggpht.com/edujez/SC5AlnB68wI/AAAAAAAAAJg/hxLqy-Dpajw/s1600-h/Myanmar-Sahana-Translation-GoogleSpreadsheet1%5B3%5D.jpg"><img style="border: 0px none ;" alt="Myanmar-Sahana-Translation-GoogleSpreadsheet1" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/edujez/SC5AmXB68xI/AAAAAAAAAJo/bhNhMOKGAqw/Myanmar-Sahana-Translation-GoogleSpreadsheet1_thumb%5B1%5D.jpg?imgmax=800" align="right" border="0" height="186" width="244" /></a>We used Google spreadsheets to co-edit the master list of all translation batches and get a live chat amongst all volunteers, without having to agree on any IM technology. That feature by itself was great as it gave a chance for volunteers to see each others' online status and ask questions of each other. Without it, we would have been caught in the middle brokering every conversation!</p>  <p>The last 20% took a big chunk of the time. As we neared the end, minor issues on collisions and questions compounded with the 24-hour cycle of getting questions asked and answered from different sides of the planet.</p>  <h3>Next steps for Sahana</h3>  <p>Next steps that various volunteers will carry on in parallel:</p>  <ol>   <li>Cleanup of work - fixing and editing the odd line and translation here and there</li>    <li>Re-encoding files- <a href="http://www.zawgyi.org/Burmese_Unit_Test_Data.aspx?start=1000" >different Burmese fonts use different encodings</a>. We chose to have faster translations at the expense of more tech work at the tail-end; which means we have to take the strings as entered by each translator in their preferred font and make it into something common. Coban Tun and other Burmese-speaking brave souls (e.g. from <a href="http://code.google.com/p/burglish/" >Burglish</a>)are tackling the choice of fonts, encodings, and conversion tools.</li>    <li>Merging files - once converted the files will be able to be merged into the format required to Sahana</li>    <li>Test</li>    <li>Check-in, deploy to the Virtual Machines, which are being made available for download</li> </ol>  <p>If you think you can help with any of the above please let us know! And congratulations to all the translators again!</p><div class="feedflare">

<p><a href="http://www.economist.com/node/13725679?story_id=13725679&amp;CFID=60498770&amp;CFTOKEN=46510551"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1985" title="Screen shot 2010-12-21 at 9.58.49 PM" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/Screen-shot-2010-12-21-at-9.58.49-PM-300x227.png" alt="" width="300" height="227" /></a>The article (which you can find <a href="http://tinyurl.com/InSTEDD-Economist">here</a>) quotes several informed and articulate sources, including staff at MIT and Path Intelligence, regarding the usefulness of mobile devices in general and our approach to data collection in particular. From my reading it's a fairly nice validation of our design and methods.<br />
<br />
Incidentally, speaking of design and methods, many of you know we have a mesh synchronization tool called Mesh4x. It's getting used all over, from African medical clinics to the US Centers for Disease Control, but it's a programming tool, not really usable by ordinary folk.</p>

<p>However, we'll soon be talking more about our new Mesh4x interface client, <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Fuse</span>, that will take our mesh synchronization capabilities and make them visible, intuitive, and usable by anyone who knows where their data resides. Mesh4x, our code library, works beautifully (we find a minor bug every few months and fix it) but it's been a developer's tool. Fuse will change that. Soon anyone will be able to specify an Excel spreadsheet here on my laptop, an Oracle database there on your server, a Google Earth KML layer on that PDA, a Microsoft Access table over in Atlanta, a MySQL database on your website's LAMP stack, and then press the Big Red Squishy Button that says "SYNC" and they'll all synchronize with each other across applications and across devices. I've watched pieces of that happen today and it's lovely to see. Even better is that, if access to the internet is broken or missing, it all can happen just over a stream of SMS text messages from a cellphone connected to a laptop. No internet at all.</p>

<p>This is very useful magic.</p>

<p>The Fuse synchronization interface design has to be very simple. Like all magic, that simplicity will mask a daunting complexity. One of the very talented people looking over the design of the Fuse interface is the remarkable Chris Blow. Chris has done beautiful work for our valued <a href="http://www.ushahidi.com/">Ushahidi</a> colleagues in the <a href="http://www.open-mobile.org/news/open-mobile-consortium-launches-open-source-mobile-tools-health-and-humanitarian-work">Open Mobile Consortium</a> and he's now working within our Innovation Laboratory in Cambodia. Chris - a very impressive <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/cambodian_worker_ilab5.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1986" title="cambodian_worker_ilab5" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/cambodian_worker_ilab5.jpg" alt="" width="478" height="358" /></a>intelligence indeed - is just visiting InSTEDD, but while he's with us he's helping the Cambodian lab students learn techniques that will let them design user interfaces that make sense for their Cambodian customers. Take a look at his blog <a href="http://unthinkingly.com/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Days like this are a part of the reason I love this organization. Yes, we're doing very good humanitarian work, using free and open source information tools that really surpass anything I'm seeing in the commercial sector, but what's really happening is that networks of truly remarkable people are forming around seriously hard problems facing the planet. Smart, passionate, selfless, creative people are finding a rewarding outlet for their need to be of service to humanity. Nice example of the Buddhist goal of "Right Livelihood".</p>";s:10:"post_title";s:44:"The Economist (again!), Fuse, and Chris Blow";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:246:"the Technology Quarterly section of the Economist  has selected a focus on InSTEDD and our work in Asia, this time for sensors, sensitivity, and the use of mobile devices for data collection.

<p style="text-align: left;">With the launch of <a title="Latin America" href="http://instedd.org/ilab/latin-america/">iLab Latin America</a> in Buenos Aires this week, InSTEDD is taking a major step in expanding an approach to sustainable local capacity building, which has been evolving over the last four years. <a title="iLabs" href="http://instedd.org/ilab/"> InSTEDD's Innovation Laboratories or iLabs</a> are focused on implementing models for sustainable development of local capacity and innovation in the design and development of technology tools to enhance collaboration and solve health, safety and development problems affecting the community.</p>
<p>Since the founding of <a title="Southeast Asia" href="http://instedd.org/ilab/southeast-asia/">iLab Southeast Asia</a> in Cambodia in 2007, the local  staff has grown and developed impressive expertise.  With the guidance  and mentorship of our international team of software engineers and  public health professionals, the local iLab staff in Southeast Asia has  learned and practiced the advanced skills needed to serve as a center  for social entrepreneurship both nationally and regionally.  ¬†  <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Screen-shot-2010-12-21-at-11.34.12-PM.png"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2061" title="An engineer from the iLab getting feedback from a user in Thailand." src="http://instedd.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Screen-shot-2010-12-21-at-11.34.12-PM-300x200.png" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a></p>
<p>In Latin America we expect to hit the ground running in partnership with a group of local software engineers at <a href="http://www.manas.com.ar/">Manas</a> who have already been working with InSTEDD on projects all around the world.  Every region has different needs and our goal in Latin America is to create a center of learning and technological innovation that is tailored to the unique needs of the region.</p>
<p><a title="Latin America" href="http://instedd.org/ilab/latin-america/">iLab Latin America</a> will help partners solve problems in health, safety and sustainable development based on an understanding of local priorities and requirements that is developed through active collaboration between software developers, domain experts and key stakeholder groups.</p>
<p>It's an exciting time for all of us at InSTEDD as we expand and test our model for capacity building in Latin America.  We look forward to sharing the lessons and achievements of iLab Latin America in the months to come.</p>

<p>The workspace is based on InSTEDD's <a href="/technologies/riff/">Riff</a>, an online application which allows a team to collaborate around multiple streams of information to assess, characterize, and respond to an event with the assistance of automated services.</p>
<p><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5330937319855833042" style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 171px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_bCfOFHv--fs/SftLP3XhP9I/AAAAAAAAAJ0/-KUNZoZGJm0/s320/SwineFlu.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></p>
<p>Our Riff Space offers a comprehensive set of collaborative features, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>commenting,</li>
<li>tagging, </li>
<li>mapping (both user generated and automated),</li>
<li>the relating of multiple alerts to each other, </li>
<li>searching and filtering (by keyword and by  location),</li>
<li>specifying a time window, </li>
<li>adding attachments, </li>
<li>subscribing (currently in the form of a web-friendly format known as GeoRSS and through an email subscription),</li>
</ul>
<p>and more.</p>
<p>The Riff Workspace is also equipped with an intelligent process (sometimes referred to as a machine-learning algorithm) that "learns" from anything provided by human experts (e.g. adding a keyword or a tag, or correcting the incorrect mapping of an item). This intelligent process quickly and accurately learns to follow advice from expert humans and we're showing a 95% confidence level for the automated selections based on previous tests. The system soon starts suggesting tags, as well as correcting itself, and gradually offers even better results over time.</p>
<p>Have you an H1N1 alert or item you like to share with the community? You can easily contribute that alert by clicking the "Add Item" feature on our Riff H1N1  workspace.</p>

The easiest way to test and play with your call flows is to use what we call a "Skype Channel". This will give Verboice a regular phone number from which it can receive and make calls to mobile phones and landlines. The name of the feature in Skype that provides that is called Skype Connect. It supports up to 300 simultaneous calls, so you can use this setup in a real scenario without any issues.<br />

Verboice allows you to use the power of voice to improve health, safety and development.

Verboice is a set of free and <a href="https://bitbucket.org/instedd/verboice/">open source</a> tools that we have been building with the goal of dramatically simplify the development of Voice-based applications. It allows organizations and communities to build their own Interactive Voice Response (IVR) applications using the infrastructure and skills they have available.

<h2>


Why would we build such a thing?</h2>
During the last few years, we have been working in many SMS-based projects and we've built an <a href="http://ndt.instedd.org/2010/08/make-your-sms-apps-scale.html">SMS service</a> to support the applications we built and to make it really easy to develop new ones. However, during that time, we saw the need to go beyond SMS.<br />
<br />
We have designed <a href="http://ndt.instedd.org/2010/05/it-without-software.html">low-tech solutions</a> for some of the problems we faced, but eventually we decided we needed to start working with <em>voice</em>. By "<em>voice</em>" I mean being able to setup information applications that can make or receive calls from users and allow them to interact by listening to options, pressing keys in their phone keypad and recording voice messages. <br />
<br />
Voice is almost ubiquitous and character independent (it doesn't matter if your phone doesn't support your language alphabet, you can always speak and listen to your own language through it), therefore making it a much more applicable solution for several contexts.<br />
<br />
At InSTEDD, we work in an agile way by building things quickly and trying them out with the people who will be using them as early on as possible. We emphasize simplicity and scalability throughout this process. We wanted a tool that would give us for Voice applications the same flexibility, scalability and simplicity that we already had for SMS applications.<br />
<br />
<h2>


Why couldn't we use what was already out there?</h2>
There are lots of voice-based tools out there, some free, some open-source, some cloud-based, but after spending some time reviewing our options, we couldn't find the kind of solution we were looking for. <br />
<br />
Here's a look at some of the existing tools:<br />
<br />
<h3>


Tropo</h3>
<a href="http://www.tropo.com/">Tropo</a> is a great web-based service that allows developers to build and run Voice applications. Tropo was a great solution for some of our scenarios:
<br />
<ul>
<li>If we were working in one of the <a href="http://blog.tropo.com/tag/countries/">40 (mostly 'developed') countries</a> they have numbers for</li>
<li>If we had internet connectivity between our customer infrastructure and Tropo</li>
<li>If we didn't need to use any local telephone company infrastructure</li>
<li>If we didn't need our customer to be able to create or modify their application themselves</li>
</ul>
However, in several situations it would not work for us:<br />
<ul>
<li> If there was no support for the country we were working. Most of Latin America, South-East Asia and Africa are not supported.</li>
<li> If we needed to connect our customer infrastructure-databases, existing systems, etc.-with the Voice application, and there was no access to the Internet. Tropo runs in the cloud, so anything you want to have interacting with it, needs to have internet access.</li>
<li> If we had to work within the infrastructure of a telephone company and connect to their telephone lines. Tropo provides their own phone numbers with their own billing. In most of the large-scale scenarios we've seen, the project involves an agreement with a telephone company that provides the 'call-termination' and, if you are lucky, a reduced cost for the calls. That scenario cannot be supported with Tropo</li>
<li> If we wanted our customers to be able to build their own simple Voice applications or maintain the ones we designed for them. Tropo requires you to have a software developer to build the app for you. There is no graphic user interface to do so.</li>
</ul>
Additionally, we hoped we could have a fully open-source and free solution. Though Tropo has released <a href="https://github.com/tropo">some of their platform</a> as open source, most of the <a href="https://github.com/tropo/tropo-servlet">core components</a> were branched in mid-2009 and have not been updated or maintained since then. We spent 2 weeks trying to install our own Tropo server and though their tech support was extremely responsive, we could not make it work. We need something simpler for our projects.<br />
<br />
<h3>


Twilio</h3>
<a href="http://www.twilio.com/">Twilio</a> is another Voice service, very similar to Tropo. The same of the above apply to this alternative, with the aggravate that <a href="http://www.twilio.com/faq/international">Twilio only provides numbers in U.S. and Canada.</a><br />
<br />
<h3>


Asterisk and Freeswitch</h3>
<a href="http://www.asterisk.org/">Asterisk</a> and <a href="http://www.freeswitch.org/">Freeswitch</a> are 2 great open source projects with incredible communities and support. Both are similar in features, and provide PBX capabilities. The role of a PBX was performed (and still is in most of the situations) by a gray box sitting in big offices with all the incoming phone lines on one side, and all the extension lines on the other. The PBX provides services like connecting incoming calls to extension, voicemail, out of office messages, and the like.<br />
<br />
Almost anything-voice can be built on top of Asterisk or Freeswitch. The issue is that both require a highly specialized programming knowledge and are far from simple to deploy, configure, use and maintain. However they provide an incredible range of support for great hardware to connect your phone lines (and that's why we support them in Verboice. Read on!) <br />
<br />
<h3>


Awaaz.De</h3>
<a href="http://awaaz.de/">Awaaz.De</a> is a relatively new <a href="http://code.google.com/p/avaajotalo/">open source</a> voice message board. It allows people to call to a number, leave voice messages and listen to others' messages. They provide a hosted-service in India so you don't need to have your own phone lines or infrastructure if you are working in that country. 

<br />
<br />
Awaaz.De is an example of the kind of development that we aim to simplify a lot. The system was built on top of IBM tools (<a href="http://domino.research.ibm.com/comm/research_people.nsf/pages/arun_kumar.WWTW.html">Spoken Web</a>, <a href="http://www-01.ibm.com/software/pervasive/voice_server/">WebSphere Voice Server</a>), requiring not only access to proprietary commercial software, but also a skilled team that can develop the application on top of it.<br />
<br />
<h3>


Freedomfone</h3>
<a href="http://www.freedomfone.org/">Freedomfone</a> provides an easy way to build interactive voice menus and polls. It is another great example of the kind of applications you could build on top of Verboice very easily.<br />
<br />
Freedomfone was built on top of Freeswitch, the Open Source PBX mentioned above. Creating applications on top of Freeswitch or Asterisk requires access to a skilled software developer with knowledge of how to install and configure the system, plus knowledge of how to develop applications on top of them.<br />
<br />
Freedomfone is great for small-scale deployments, as you don't need an internet connection and it can run on your own server. That is also the downside: you need your own server, plus a hardware device that you use to put the SIM cards that will be used to make the phone calls. There is no way to connect it to Voice-over-IP lines or more "enterprise-like" infrastructure.<br />
<br />
<h2>


So what are we building?</h2>
Our solution is composed of several layers. When you use one of the outer layers, you don't see or care what's below. If that layer is not flexible enough for your needs, you peel that one and use the one beneath.<br />
<br />
Starting from the outer layer and going down, we are building <b>6 layers</b>:<br />
<br />
<h3>
1-A Web graphic user interface for building simple voice applications</h3>
This tool will be hosted online, and you will be able to build simple interactive voice applications, by visually configuring the steps in your account. There is no need for a software developer or a server at this level. For now however, you do need a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_over_Internet_Protocol">Voice over IP (VoIP)</a> phone line provider. We will put together a list of recommended providers in several countries and would gladly help you find one in your country. <br />
<br />
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
<a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-pt0T3DqAE_c/TrA442_PC-I/AAAAAAAAABI/ocZ5WUe8qvA/s1600/02-add.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="326" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-pt0T3DqAE_c/TrA442_PC-I/AAAAAAAAABI/ocZ5WUe8qvA/s400/02-add.jpg" width="400" /></a></div>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
<br /></div>
If VoIP does not work for you, you can always download Verboice to your own server and connect your phone line to it. In this case, you still don't need a software developer as you would still be building your application visually, but you'd need somebody that can install and configure the server.<br />
<br />
This tool will support the most common voice interactions and provide great flexibility, while still being simple to use.<br />

<tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;">This are some of the steps you can include in your application</span></td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<br />
<br />
<h3>
2-A script-hosting web server.</h3>
If you need more flexibility to build your application than what the graphic user interface provides, we support two XML-based voice standards: <a href="http://www.twilio.com/docs/api/twiml/">Twilio Markup Language (TwiML)</a>, <a href="http://www.voicexml.org/">VoiceXML</a>.<br />
<br />
Those XML languages allow your developer to easily script a complete voice application. You don't need your own server, you can still upload the script to ours and run it from there, but you do need to provide your VOIP phone-line.<br />
<br />
As with before, you can always download and deploy this to your own server and connect your phone lines to it.<br />
<br />
<h3>
3-A web service that allows you to program your own custom applications</h3>
If the script is not enough and you have a willing software developer, you can use our web programming service to power your voice applications. The good thing is that your developer can work in the language of his choice, .NET, Java, Ruby, PHP, Python, etc. anything can interact with our web service. This way you can have your Voice application interact with any existing database or system you already have in place. <br />
<br />
This is the level at which you would use Tropo and Twilio.<br />
<br />
Again, if you have your own server, you can host your application plus Verboice there, and avoid requiring an Internet connection.<br />
<br />
<h3>
4-A library to interact directly and synchronously with Verboice</h3>
If you still need finer control and don't want to rely on your application communicating with Verboice through the internet, you can have it interact directly through code with Verboice.

<br />
<br />
<h3>
5-An open source and free voice engine</h3>
All of the above is open source, as well as the core component that powers the Voice functionality. In case you are doing something extreme or there are features we don't yet support, you can always modify the source code and adapt it to your needs. We'll gladly welcome your contribution!

<br />
<br />
<h3>
6-A pluggable call-termination backend</h3>
If you are still reading, it's getting more complicated here. If none of the above has answered how to have your users call to your application, this is where you can might find an answer. Verboice is built "PBX-agnostic", meaning that it can sit on top of anything you have receiving or making the phone calls. We've built support for SIP phone lines (the VOIP standard), Asterisk and Freeswitch. Those last 2 cover a great deal of hardware options. <br />
<br />
If you are working with hardware that is not supported by Asterisk or Freeswitch, and VOIP is not good for you, you can always build your adapter to whatever infrastructure you need to use, or you can <a href="http://instedd.org/contact-us/" >contact us</a> and we'll build it for you!<br />
<br />
<h2>


Examples</h2>
We've built Watchfire on top of Verboice. Watchfire was originally developed for the Red Cross with support from Cisco to help them recruit volunteers, but can be used for any geographic-based, massive yes-or-no confirmation by people. <a href="http://ndt.instedd.org/2011/09/live-recruiting-of-volunteers-through.html" >Read more about Watchfire</a>.<br />
<br />
Together with <a href="http://www.popcouncil.org/" >PopCouncil</a>, <a href="http://www.popcouncil.org/mediacenter/newsreleases/2011_BabyMonitorAward.asp" >we have been awarded a grant</a> to take clinical screening to women in the critical period before and after birth. "Baby Monitor" will be built on top of Verboice.<br />
<br />
<h2>


Next steps</h2>
We are working hard at completing and improving all the components described above, while we learn from the work on our current Voice projects.<a href="https://groups.google.com/group/instedd-tech/" > Get in touch</a> if you have questions, ideas on things you would like us to build or support, or a project you would want Verboice for.</div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9028461146492626696-7370636880002487475?l=ndt.instedd.org' alt='' /></div>";s:10:"post_title";s:60:"Verboice - Listen and respond to the voice of your community";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:255:"

However, during that time, we saw the need to go beyond SMS.<br /><br />We have designed <a href="http://ndt.instedd.org/2010/05/it-without-software.html">low-tech solutions</a> for some of the problems we faced, but eventually we decided we needed to start working with <em>voice</em>. By "<em>voice</em>" I mean being able to setup information applications that can make or receive calls from users and allow them to interact by listening to options, pressing keys in their phone keypad and recording voice messages. <br /><br />Voice is almost ubiquitous and character independent (it doesn't matter if your phone doesn't support your language alphabet, you can always speak and listen to your own language through it), therefore making it a much more applicable solution for several contexts.<br /><br />At InSTEDD, we work in an agile way by building things quickly and trying them out with the people who will be using them as early on as possible. We emphasize simplicity and scalability throughout this process. We wanted a tool that would give us for Voice applications the same flexibility, scalability and simplicity that we already had for SMS applications.<br /><br /><h2>  Why couldn't we use what was already out there?</h2>There are lots of voice-based tools out there, some free, some open-source, some cloud-based, but after spending some time reviewing our options, we couldn't find the kind of solution we were looking for. <br /><br />Here's a look at some of the existing tools:<br /><br /><h3>  Tropo</h3><a href="http://www.tropo.com/">Tropo</a> is a great web-based service that allows developers to build and run Voice applications. Tropo was a great solution for some of our scenarios: <br /><ul><li>If we were working in one of the <a href="http://blog.tropo.com/tag/countries/">40 (mostly 'developed') countries</a> they have numbers for</li><li>If we had internet connectivity between our customer infrastructure and Tropo</li><li>If we didn't need to use any local telephone company infrastructure</li><li>If we didn't need our customer to be able to create or modify their application themselves</li></ul>However, in several situations it would not work for us:<br /><ul><li> If there was no support for the country we were working.

Due to poor network connectivity and literacy barriers, rural Cambodians are inhibited from using many technologies. While many people in rural Cambodia have access to mobile phones, literacy and Khmer language support on mobile devices is still limited. This poses a significant barrier to using SMS based mobile applications and makes voice based systems a more desirable alternative.</p>

Verboice projects can start small and scale up, making it possible to improve lives even in communities previously closed off by literacy and technological barriers. Below are a few of the projects to come out of this grant.</p>
<div>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><strong><br /></strong></strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Verboice + Open Institute &amp; Women‚Äôs Media Centre ¬†<img class="size-full wp-image-5909 alignleft" title="OI+WMC" src="http://instedd.org/wp-content/uploads/OI+WMC.jpg" alt="" width="233" height="233" /></strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.ilabsoutheastasia.org/">InSTEDD iLab Southeast Asia </a>partnered with the <a href="http://open.org.kh/">Open Institute,</a> and the <a href="http://www.wmc.org.kh/">Women‚Äôs Media Centre</a> to improve their outreach services which focus on women‚Äôs health, gender-based violence, and democracy. ¬†¬†The project is to assist the Women‚Äôs Media Centre and Open Institute in implementing a series of mobile-based information telephone hotlines, scheduled advice services and question boxes for women that complement and extend their current work. Through a customized version of Verboice, women and children will be able to access on demand health information services, therefore increasing their awareness and understanding of health issues they may be at risk for. ¬†For more information on this project, check out the Spider website <a href="http://www.spidercenter.org/projects/interactive-voice-response-systems-support-women-and-children">here</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">¬†</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Verboice + International Labor Organization (ILO)</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5910" title="ILO+BFC" src="http://instedd.org/wp-content/uploads/ILO+BFC.jpg" alt="" width="233" height="181" />In addition to supporting women‚Äôs health, we are working on a project with the <a href="http://www.ilo.org/global/lang--en/index.htm">International Labour Organization (ILO)</a> to support factory workers throughout Cambodia. ¬†<a href="http://www.betterfactories.org/">Better Factories Cambodia (BFC)</a> helps to monitor and improve working conditions in Cambodia‚Äôs export garment factories.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Verboice will enable ILO‚Äôs Better Factories Cambodia to connect directly with factory workers and help them better understand their rights.¬†Using Verboice, BFC is developing a quiz, which¬†will allow garment factory workers to call in to the system to answer several questions related to¬†salaries, work safety and personal health.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Verboice + Marie Stopes International</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5919" title="Marie Stopes" src="http://instedd.org/wp-content/uploads/Marie-Stopes.jpg" alt="" width="233" height="135" />Cambodia is infamous for having one of the highest number of maternal deaths and disability in Asia. Many Cambodian women have limited access to reliable and modern family planning methods, which results in high rates of unwanted pregnancies. All too often, women believe that dangerous and extreme measures are their only options. The result is that 25% of all maternal deaths in Cambodia are the result of unsafe, unregistered and unscrupulous abortion providers.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Based on the belief that when individuals are empowered to be decision makers in their own reproductive health destiny, they are able to live happier, healthier and more prosperous lives, <a href="http://www.mariestopes.org.kh/">Marie Stopes International Cambodia </a>helps to increase access to high quality, safe and affordable reproductive and sexual health services. Marie Stopes International Cambodia provides comprehensive safe abortion care and has the highest rates of post abortion family planning uptake in Cambodia.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Marie Stopes is using Verboice as part of their post abortion follow-up process. ¬†This IVR is used as an educational resource to ensure that women have access to more information about safer alternative contraception options.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>Verboice + BBC Media Action</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5920" title="BBC+Loy9" src="http://instedd.org/wp-content/uploads/BBC+Loy9.jpg" alt="" width="233" height="135" />For the past 10 years, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediaaction/where_we_work/asia/cambodia">BBC ‚Äî Media Action</a> has used media channels such as TV and radio to improve health throughout Cambodia. Their projects have tackled maternal and child health issues, HIV and AIDS and malaria.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Funded by UNDP and implemented by the BBC Media Action, <a href="http://loy9.com.kh/en/">Loy9</a> is an entertaining and inspiring mass media campaign on TV, radio, online and print, which focuses on engaging youth in local and national decision making.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As an extension to the TV, radio and online presence, we are working with BBC Media Action to¬†customize Verboice to support Loy9 to empower youth‚Äôs social involvement through on demand¬†content accessible through mobile phones.</p>

My takeaways: communicate what we are doing more often, and have clear channels to participate in design. We are taking the feedback and this week we re-opened the <a href="http://instedd.org/techforums" >InSTEDD online forums</a> on our website and a collaborative design <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/instedd-design" >group</a> for GeoChat. One of the challenges with having such a great team is that things happen fast&#160; for example, Mesh4x over 2 weeks, the KML Sync work in 5 days) and we need to consider this when working with a community of folks whose insight would make the stuff better and who could imagine new uses for the technologies.</p>  <p><a href="http://lh3.ggpht.com/edujez/SC3HW3B68oI/AAAAAAAAAIg/NpwESwjgZLk/s1600-h/image%5B19%5D.png"><img style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="185" alt="Jonathan in the Where 2.0 speakers&#39; lounge, designin&#39; what he needs for GeoChat" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/edujez/SC3Ha3B68pI/AAAAAAAAAIo/ahi5oZhkWMg/image_thumb%5B9%5D.png?imgmax=800" width="244" align="right" border="0" /></a>In that spirit we started an open discussion about the direction for our technologies. The <a href="http://instedd.org/smsgeochat" >GeoChat</a> work attracted a lot of attention. Jonathan Thompson was particularly engaged giving scenarios about position updates via Thuraya satellite phones and email. Not only he embarked with us on some interactive design there-and-then but also started contacting his buddies in the far field to ask them for feedback on the scenario. Awesome! For some reason the code in the Google Code project has fallen behind the tree we check-in to, we'll be fixing it next week.</p>  <p>One of the demos was about our <a href="http://edjez.instedd.org/2008/05/build-maps-collaboratively-with-new.html" >KML Mesh4x adapter</a> (a preview of the type of things you can do with <a href="http://mesh4x.org" >Mesh4x</a>). We got some good feedback on getting the versioning info embedded into the KML file, making it equally functional but more elegant. Play with it! See how you can sync one or more local maps with each other or with a cloud-based service, for example, setting up the N-way topology below (I was saving this sweet pic for another blog post but what the heck)</p>  <p><a href="http://lh4.ggpht.com/edujez/SC3HeHB68qI/AAAAAAAAAIw/mEsXryVZOoc/s1600-h/image%5B26%5D.png"><img style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="384" alt="You can replicate this synchronization topology today with the mesh4x KML adapter download" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/edujez/SC3HiHB68rI/AAAAAAAAAI4/tDpr1Ve4_1s/image_thumb%5B14%5D.png?imgmax=800" width="462" border="0" /></a> </p>  <p>The morning of our talk <a href="http://brainoff.com/weblog/" >Mikel Maron</a> and <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/jesse/" >Jesse Robbins</a> gave a new variation their &quot;Disaster Tech&quot; presentation (<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/jesserobbins/etech2008-disastertech-robbins-maron-20080305a/" >eTech presentation from them on similar topic</a>), and did a great job of describing the tensions that exist when high-tech stuff meets high-risk environments.</p>  <p>We had the honor to have our batch of talks presented by Tim O'Reilly himself. I was humbled by the reaction of the crowd to the Sahana localization to Burmese for Myanmar Nargis relief <a href="http://edjez.instedd.org/2008/05/sahana-installation-poised-for-myanmar.html" >crowdsourcing effort</a>. With the smarts, expertise, and experience in the audience, better and more efficient approaches can be invented. Here are our slides, without the associated bobbing heads:</p>  <p><a href="http://lh6.ggpht.com/edujez/SC3H0nB68sI/AAAAAAAAAJA/YhgKNYq6MjY/s1600-h/image%5B31%5D.png"><img style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="157" alt="Astronauts are cool" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/edujez/SC3H23B68tI/AAAAAAAAAJI/5wQ5riwc_mA/image_thumb%5B19%5D.png?imgmax=800" width="212" align="right" border="0" /></a>Last but not least, this event was particularly well-put together for speakers. The O'Reilly staff was super friendly and the backstage folks very professional. I've spoken in countless events of different magnitudes, with audiences of dozens to thousands, and was positively impressed.</p>  <p>It's impossible to record every interaction and some things are worth blogging by themselves but hopefully this gives you an idea of what's been going on the last days.</p>  <div class="feedflare">

<p><span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>What do these three groups have in common? ¬†</strong></span><br />They could all benefit from occasional reminders to keep them on track. ¬†This is where one of our latest <strong>free and open source</strong> tools, <a href="../technologies/remindem/">Remindem</a> comes into play. ¬†Health care providers, professors or individuals can set up a system of unique, scheduled reminders which will be sent out via text message to subscribers. ¬†We imagine that applications of Remindem will vary across countries and communities, but it could look like a schedule of text messages for HIV prevention and safer sex tips for high risk communities or a set of appointment reminders, pre-natal development milestones and suggestions for eating healthy that a health care provider offers to all expecting mothers. ¬†</p>
